<h2><a name="Preface_to_the_third_edition_of_The_Manufacture" id="Preface_to_the_third_edition_of_The_Manufacture">Preface to the third edition of “The Manufacture
of Chocolate” by Dr. Zipperer.</a></h2>


<p>It is now a decade since the appearance of the last edition, and
owing to continual delays in the compiling of the present volume, the
book has been out of print for several years. These delays ensued
because the editor wished to take into account the most recent determinations
and decrees of the guilds and various legislative factors
connected with the industry; but he was at length forced to the
conclusion that notwithstanding the excellent organisation and lofty
standing of the branch under consideration, it was useless to wait
for anything final and absolute in such a field. Suggestions of possible
improvements and indications of blemishes are therefore earnestly
invited, in order that they may be duly allowed for in the event of
a new edition.—The plan followed by Zipperer has been adopted
in the main; a tribute due to its previous success. Yet on the other
hand, the arrangement of the book has undergone some alteration,
and is, at least in the editor’s opinion, a perceptible improvement.—All
scientific, industrial and technical progress has been treated as
fully as possible, the economic part in particular having been
diligently recast.</p>

<p>It would, of course, have been impossible for the editor to
write all these chapters without external aid, his knowledge of the
respective branches being by no means exhaustive enough. He may
therefore be allowed to express here his obligation and thanks to
all his fellow-workers; and in particular, to the <em class="gesperrt">Association of
German Chocolate Manufacturers</em>, Dresden; its managing
director, Herr Greiert; the director of the <em class="gesperrt">Cocoa Purchase
Co.</em>, Hamburg, Herr Rittscher, who contributed the whole of the
chapter headed; <em class="gesperrt">Commercial Varieties of Cacao Beans</em>;
further to Prof. Dr. Härtel, Chief Inspector of the Royal Research
Institute, Leipsic; Dr. R. Böhme, Managing Director of Messrs. Stollwerck
Bros. Chemical Laboratory, Cologne; and to Superintendent
Engineer Schneider, of the firm J. M. Lehman, Dresden, among many
others. Mention must also be made of the manufacturers who so
kindly placed material at the editor’s disposal. Let us hope that
the work will meet with a success corresponding to the pains taken
by the editor and publishers, and prove a really serviceable <em class="gesperrt">Handbook
to the Chocolate Industry</em>.</p>

second editions.</a></h2>


<p>The object of this work is to furnish a source of information
and advice for those who are interested in the branch of industry
to which it relates.</p>

<p>The author of this treatise has therefore endeavoured not only
to describe the manufacturing processes; but he has also devoted
special attention to the raw materials employed, and endeavoured
to make them generally familiar by reference to the literature on the
subject, as well as by providing a precise account of the chemical
constituents of these substances and discussing the consequently
necessary procedure to be observed in the course of manufacture.
The art of chocolate making is no longer what it was a few decades
ago; it has for the most part passed from small operators into the
hands of large manufacturers. A short historical resumé will serve
as a sketch of this development and a cursory description of some
forms of apparatus which have now merely historical interest will
serve to show how improvement in the industry has been effected.</p>

<p>Chocolate is a favourite and most important article of food,
and in that sense it is subject to legal regulations for which allowances
must be made, as well as for the most suitable analytical methods
by means of which a manufacturer can ascertain the presence of
unlawful mixtures in competing products, so that knowing the regulations
in force, he may avoid any infringement of the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within the ten years that have elapsed since the first edition
of this work appeared, the manufacture of chocolate has undergone
considerable expansion. Not only has the <em class="gesperrt">modus operandi</em> been
simplified and improved by the introduction of a number of new
mechanical appliances, but the technique of the subject has been so
extended, both from chemical and mechanical points of view, as partly
to furnish a new standard in estimating and determining cacao constituents
and preparations. The author has endeavoured to take
due account of all these advances, and made a point of collecting
the material scattered through the various professional journals,
sifting or supplementing where necessary, in order that all engaged
in the industry, <em class="gesperrt">the manufacturer as well as the food
analyst and the engineer</em>, may be in a position to derive a
vivid impression of existing conditions in the chocolate manufacture,
from the present volume.</p>

<p>In consideration of the importance which several branches
of the industry have recently acquired, such as the preparation
of cocoa powder, soluble cocoa, cacao butter, pralinés
and chocolate creams, space has been given to descriptions
of the respective details. On the other hand no attempt has been
made to introduce calculations as to the cost of manufacture, since
statements to that effect would possibly be rather detrimental than
otherwise.</p>

<p>Costs of production as regards cacao preparations is subject
to great variation, according to the scale on which they are carried
out, so that estimates made on the basis of large operations might
eventually lead to the conclusion that a small factory might be profitable,
and with no better result than that of creating undue competition
in prices and occasioning eventual failure. Moreover, the
fluctuations in the market price of cacao and sugar are so frequent,
and there is such possibility of new sources of expense, that calculations
can only apply to the time when they are made; they soon
become out of date, and then afford no trustworthy indication of
probable profit and loss.</p>

<p>The section treating of legislative regulations relating to the
trade in cacao preparations has undergone complete revision to
adapt it to existing conditions.</p>

<p>To render the book more useful, an appendix has been added
in which the production and composition of a few cacao preparations
are treated of, providing valuable data for reference.</p>

The Cacao Tree.</h2>


<h3 id="A_Tree_and_Beans">A. Tree and Beans.</h3>


<h4>a) Description of the Cacao Tree and its Fruit.</h4>

<p>The cacao tree with its clusters of red blossom and golden
yellow fruits is conspicuous even in tropical vegetation. Of considerable
diameter at the base, it often attains a height of eight
metres. Its wood is porous and light; the bark is cinnamon coloured,
the simply alternating leaves are from 30 to 40 cm. in length and from
10 to 12 cm. broad, growing on stalks about 3 cm. long. The upper
surface of these leaves is bright green, and the other one of a duller
colour, and slightly hairy.</p>

<p>The flowers, which are often covered with hairs, occur either
singly or united in bunches not only on the thicker branches but also
all along the trunk from the root upwards. (Fig. 1 A.)</p>

<p>The formation of the fruit takes place only from the flowers
of the stem or thicker branches, and for a thousand flowers there is
only one ripe fruit.</p>

<p>The flowers (fig. 1 B &amp; C) are very small and of a reddish
white colour. Calyx and corolla are five partite, the ten filaments
are united at their base (fig. 1 G) and only half of them are developed
to fruitful organs, such as bear pollen (fig. 1 J) in their four separate
anther compartments (fig. 1 H).</p>

<p>The pistil is formed of five united carpels and bears in each of
its five compartments eight ovules. (Fig. 1 E &amp; F).</p>

<p>The fruit is at first green, and afterwards turns yellow, but
with streaks and tints of red occurring; many varieties also are
entirely crimson. Resembling our cucumber in size, shape and
appearance (see fig. <a href="#Page_3">2 A &amp; B</a>), it has a length of about 25 cm. and a
diameter of 10 cm., and the thickness of its shell is from 15 to 20 mm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
This shell is of rather softer consistency than that of the gourd, and
has five deep longitudinal channels, with five others of less depth
between them.</p>

<i>E</i> Bean-pod in vertical section (6/1) <i>F</i> Bean-pod in cross section (9/1). <i>H</i> Anther. <i>J</i> Pollen.</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>The shell encloses a soft, sweetish pulp, within which from
twenty-five to forty almond shaped seeds are ranged in five longitudinal
rows, close to each other. The white colour of these seeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
is frequently tinged with yellow, crimson, or violet (Sec. Fig. 2
C. D. &amp; G).</p>

<p>The fruits ripen throughout the whole year, though but slowly
during the dry season; and the time needed for its full development
is about four months. It may be gathered at all times of the year,
although there are regular gathering seasons, determined and
modified by the respective climatic conditions. So, for example, we
find that in Brazil the principal gathering takes place in February
and July, whilst in Mexico it is in March and April. In the primeval
Amazonian forests the fruit of the cacao tree is gathered and brought
to market at all times of the year, wherever Indian tribes obtain.</p>


<h4>b) Geographical Distribution and History
of the Cacao Tree.</h4>

<p>The cacao tree flourishes in a warm, moist climate. It is therefore
indigenous to tropical America, from 23° north to 15° or 20°
south latitude.</p>

<p>Consequently the area in which it grows comprises the Central
American republic of Mexico down to the Isthmus of Panama; Guatemala,
the Greater and Lesser Antilles, Martinique, Trinidad, St. Lucia,
Granada, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, and San
Domingo; in South America, the republics of Venezuela, Columbia,
Guiana, Ecuador, Peru and the northern parts of Brazil, especially
the districts lying along the middle Amazon.</p>

<p>In all other countries where the cacao tree now flourishes, it
has been naturalised, either by colonists, or with government aid, as
in Asia, where the Philippine Islands, Java, Celebes, Amboyna and
Ceylon in particular are deserving of mention; and in Cameroon
(Bibundi, Victoria and Buea), Bourbon, San Thomé and the Canary
Islands in Africa, where the tree is sometimes found growing at an
elevation of about 980 ft. above sea level. Ceylon offers an instructive
illustration of the zeal with which the cultivation is carried
on in some districts. According to information furnished by Mr.
Ph. Freudenburg, late German Consul at Colombo, cacao had been
planted in a few instances during the time Ceylon was in possession
of the Dutch, but only since 1819 has seed been distributed out of
the botanical gardens at Kalatura, and it was still later before planters
could obtain it from those established at Peradenija. Systematic
cultivation for commercial purposes was commenced in 1872 or 1873.
The principal seats of cacao plantations are Dumbara, Kurunegalla,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Kegalla and Polgahawella, together with North, East and West Matala,
Urah and Panwila.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> According to statistical records, the relation
between the growth and export of cacao is shown by the following
table, which also shows the development of its cultivation:</p>

<p>Like all other articles of human food, cacao has a history of
some interest, the most essential points of which are here summarised
from the excellent work of A. Mitscherlich.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>A knowledge of the cacao tree was first brought to Europe in
1519 by Fernando Cortez and his troops. He found in Mexico a very
extensive cultivation of cacao, which had been carried on for several
centuries. In the first letter addressed by Cortez to Charles the
Fifth, he described cacao beans as being used in place of money. Cortez
applied to the cacao tree the name of “Cacap”, a word derived
from the old Mexican designation “Cacava-quahitl”. The Mexicans
called the fruit “Cacavacentli”, the beans “Cacahoatl” and the beverage
prepared from them “Chocolatl”<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, said to be derived from the
root “Cacava” and “Atl”, water. This term was adopted by the
Spaniards, and it gave rise in the course of time to the word “Chocolate”,
which is now universal.</p>

<p>The botanical definition of the typical form of the cacao tree,
which belongs to the family BUTTNERIACEAE, is referable to Linnaeus,
who gave it the name “Theobroma Cacao” (food of the gods,
from “Theos”, God, and “Broma”, food). Probably chocolate was a
favourite beverage with Linnaeus, who may have been acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
with the work of the Paris physician Buchat, published in 1684, in
which chocolate is alluded to as an invention more worthy of being
called food of the gods than nectar or ambrosia. Clusius first described
the cacao tree in his “Plantae exoticae”. The taste for chocolate
soon spread throughout Spain after the return of Cortez’ expedition
from the New World, not, however, without encountering
some opposition, especially on the part of the clergy, who raised the
question whether it were lawful to partake of chocolate on fast days,
as it was known to possess nutritive properties. However, it found
an advocate in Cardinal Brancatio, who described it as an article
belonging, like wine, to the necessaries of life, and he therefore held
that its use in moderation could not be prohibited. In 1624 Franciscus
Rauch published a work at Vienna, in which he condemned the use
of chocolate and suggested that the monks should be prevented from
partaking of it, as a means of preventing excesses. About the commencement
of the 17th century, the use of chocolate spread from
Spain to Italy, where it was brought to the notice of the public by the
Florentine Antonio Carletti (1606), who had lived for some time in the
Antilles. The method of converting cacao beans into chocolate was
also made known in Europe by Carletti, while the Spaniards had
kept it a secret. Under Theresa of Austria, wife of Louis XIV, the
habit of taking chocolate appears to have become very common in
France after the partial introduction of cacao by importation from
Spain. The first cacao imported from the French colony of Martinique
arrived in Brest in 1679 in “Le Triomphant”, the flagship of
admiral d’Estrées. Opinion in France as to chocolate was then divided:
Madame Sévigné, once an admirer of chocolate, afterwards
wrote to her daughter: “il vous flatte pour un temps et puis il vous
allume tout d’un coup fièvre continue qui vous conduit à la mort”, a
theory which nowadays must necessarily be regarded as ridiculous.</p>

<p>Chocolate was in general use in England about the middle of
the 17th century. Chocolate houses, similar to the coffee houses of
Germany, were opened in London. Bontekoë, physician to
the Elector Wilhelm of Brandenburg, published in 1679 a work
entitled “Tractat van Kruyd, Thee, Coffe, Chocolate,” in which
he spoke very strongly in favour of chocolate and contributed very
sensibly to the increase of its consumption in Germany. The first
chocolate factory in Germany is said to have been erected by Prince
Wilhelm von der Lippe about the year 1756 at Steinhude. This prince
brought over Portuguese specially versed in the art of chocolate
making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>


<h4>c) Cultivation of the Cacao Tree; Diseases
and Parasites.</h4>

<p>The first information regarding the cultivation of the cacao tree
in Mexico is that obtained on the invasion of the country by the Spaniards.
Prior to that time there is a total absence of anything definite.
The tree flourishes best in situations where the mean temperature
is between 24° and 28° C. The farther the place of cultivation
from the equator the poorer is the product. The other most
essential conditions are long continued moisture of the soil and a soft,
loose texture with abundance of humus, and above all, shelter from
the direct rays of the sun. For these reasons, planters select for their
cacao areas ground the virgin soil of which has not been exhausted by
the cultivation of other plants. The plants are either raised in a
nursery until they reach the most suitable age for transplanting, or
the seeds are sown on the ground selected for the plantation. The
transport of live seed for new plantations is attended with some
difficulty, since the seeds very quickly lose their vitality. C. Chalot<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
recommends that this vitality be preserved by gathering the fruit
before it is perfectly ripe, immersing it in melted paraffin oil, and then
wrapping it in paper; on which the fruit may be transported without
losing any of its nutritive qualities.</p>

<p>In the sheltered valleys of tropical countries, where the soft
soil, rich in humus, is kept constantly moist by large rivers, the cacao
tree blossoms throughout the whole year. When growing wild it is
generally isolated under the shadow of larger trees; when cultivated,
the young plant is placed under the shelter of banana trees, and at a
later period of its growth shelter is provided by the coral (called
Erythrina corallodendron or Erythrina indica), further known as
“Coffie-mama” among the Surinam Dutch and madre del cacao among
the Spaniards. Yet this tree, like the Maniok, is said not to enjoy
so long a life as the cacao plant, which sometimes reaches an age of
forty years. On this account the Castilloa or also Caesalpina
dashyracis have recently been recommended as a more lasting protection.
The fact that it does not lose its leaves during the dry
season (e. g. on Java, during the East Monsoon) is an additional
advantage.</p>

<p>A cacao plantation requires a considerable area, in the proportion
of 50 hectares for 20,000 trees. The quantity of fruit to be
obtained from that number of trees, as an annual crop, would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
worth from £ 1,200-1,300. In planting the seeds, they are set in rows
that are from 8 to 10 m. apart, four or five seeds being planted within
from 1 to 2 m, the shading trees being planted between the rows.
Of each five seeds planted the greater number often fail to germinate,
either in consequence of unfavourable weather or as the result of
attacks by insects etc.; but if more than one plant grows, the weaker
ones are pulled up. Until the plants are two or three years old,
they are protected by a shed open at one side, and they are transplanted
after they have attained a height of 3 ft. The chief enemies
of tropical cultivation—weeds, aerial roots, insects, bacterial infection—have
to be provided against continually, so as to prevent damage;
accordingly if the ground be not moist enough, it should be systematically
watered, and so drained if marshy, for the tree requires most
careful nursing if it is to develop into a prolific fruit-bearing specimen.
The seed germinates about fourteen days after being planted; but
flowers are not produced till after 3 or 5 years. After the tree has
once born fruit, which may occur at the end of the fourth year it
often continues to do so for fifty years. The tree is most prolific
when from twelve to thirty years old.</p>

<p>As in the case of all cultivated plants and domestic animals,
the existence of which does not depend on the principal of natural
selection, and among which life is not a continuous development of
endurance in the face of adverse elements, the cacao tree has its
peculiar diseases. Indeed, it would seem as though it were beset by
all vermin extant. The reader may obtain some idea of the extent of
the damage done to cacao plantations by such noxious agents, if he
turns up the clear and exhaustive account published by the Imperial
Biological Institute for Agriculture and Forestry (Germany).<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
Unfortunately we have not space here to mention more than a few
of the most frequently occurring and important diseases, such as the
GUM DISEASE, which is especially destructive, gum formations in
the wood tissue and bark of the tree eventually killing it. Next
to be dreaded are the various fungus growths, cancers and cancer-like
incrustations (“Krulloten”) and broom formations. It often
happens that specii of beetle attack the tree, causing decay and rot
to set in; such e. g. are the wood-borer, bark bug, and woodbeetle.
Other parasites, again, do not destroy the whole tree, but are
equally detrimental, as they also preclude all prospects of a harvest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Fruit rot and its like, fruit cancer, and cacao moths, are notorious
in this connection. There are also several larger creatures which
betray a preference for the nutritious fruit of the cacao tree, various
species of rat, and the squirrel, which unite to make the planter’s
life a burden.</p>


<h4>d) Gathering and Fermentation.</h4>

<p>The gathering of the fruit is effected by means of long rods,
at the end of which is a semi-circular knife for cutting through the
stalk. The fruits are then split in two, the beans separated from
the surrounding pulp and spread out on screens to dry, or exposed to
the sun on bamboo floors. Beans so prepared are described as
unfermented.</p>

<p>In most lands where cacao is cultivated, another process is
adopted, calculated to heighten the flavour of the fruit and develop
its nutritious constituents. The newly gathered beans are first
partially freed from the fruity substances always adhering, then
piled up into heaps and covered with banana skins or cocoa-nut
matting, in order that they may be shut off as far as possible from
all atmospheric influence, and so left for some time, while the
chemical processes of warming and fermentation are gradually
consummating. This procedure is alternated with repeated exposures
to the sun, according to the maturity and species of the cacao bean,
and the prevailing weather conditions; though details as to the
length of time and number of repetitions necessary to the production
of a marketable article still await determination.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> It may be taken as
a general rule that fermentation should proceed till the bean, or
rather the cotyledon, has acquired the light brown colour characteristic
of chocolate. This principle is nevertheless often violated,
especially as loss of weight in the bean is often intimately connected
with complete fermentation. Unsufficiently fermented varieties, but
which were fully ripe when gathered, develop a violet colour during
this process; it is possible for them to pass through what is known
as “After fermentation” before reaching the factory. This is not
so in the case of beans developing from unripe fruit, for obviously
the valuable constituents of the cotyledon are here not prominent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
and scarcely calculated to ferment properly. Such can be recognised
by their betraying a bluish grey colour in the drying processes, and
the soft and smooth structure which they then acquire. A normal
progress of fermentation is indicated where the interior of the mass
of beans registers, on the first morning after gathering, a temperature
not exceeding 30-33° C, 35-38° on the second day, and on the
third morning a temperature not exceeding 43° C. If the outer shells
are marked, the heating has been too severe. In countries where the
harvest season suffers from the periodical rains, drying over wooden
fires<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> is often resorted to. The value of many specimens is hereby
greatly diminished when the roasting is carelessly managed, for the
smoke must on no account be allowed to come into contact with the
bean. Yet “Smoky” lots among the St. Thomas, Accra, and Kameroon
sorts were formerly much more frequent in commerce than now, for
the planter has learned to avoid this evil. After they have been
fermented, the beans are washed, or trodden with the naked foot, in
some countries, and so cleansed from the pulp remains still adhering.
They are then allowed to dry in the open air, and packed into sacks;
contact with metal or stone is strictly to be avoided, which as good
conductors of heat and rapid cooling agents are most disadvantageous.
Instead of piling the beans up in loose heaps, they may be
fermented in “Tanks” made of wood, and where possible, provided
with partitions. According to Kindt, cedar wood has been proved
best for this purpose, because of its enormous resisting capacity. It
used to be thought that in fermentation ensued a germination of the
seed,<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> as in the preparation of malt; but this idea has been proved
erroneous. The contrary is rather the case, for the process almost
kills the seed; and when the sensitiveness of the latter is taken into
consideration, and also the fact that it only develops under the most
favourable conditions, it must be allowed that the statement contains
an obvious truth. Yet chemical change does take place in the fermentation
of the seed; but as to its precise nature, owing to the
lack of scientific research on the scene of operations, we are still
unable to dogmatise. It would therefore be useless to discuss the
manifold theories and speculations bearing on this point, and waste of
time to discuss the various kinds of fermentation and the chemical
processes therein involved. Yet it may almost be taken for granted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
that the fresh-plucked bean contains a so-called glycoside<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> which
decomposes into grape sugar, into an equally amyloids colour stuff
(the so-called cacao-red), and the nitrogeneous alkaloids Theobromine
and Kaffein; a change probably incidental to the fermentation.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The
sugar might further split up into Alcohol and Carbonic Acid Gas,
although this is by no means established.</p>

<p>Whilst we have lost our bearings as far as the chemical aspect
of this process is concerned, we are much more firm in respect to
the biological, thanks to researches which Dr. v. Preyers has conducted
on the spot in Ceylon. Preyer’s<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> experiments leave absolutely no
room for objection, and it can safely be accepted that there are no
bacteria present in fermentation, but a fungus-like growth rich in
life, a kind of yeast by him called Saccharomyces Theobromae, and
described in passing;<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> facts which constitute the gist of his findings.
He further establishes that the presence of bacteria often noticed
is absolutely undesirable, and that better results are obtained when
all life is energetically combated, and especially these bacteria. We
should, then, be confronted with the same phenomenon in the preparation
of cacao as are already met with in beer brewing, and the
pressing of wine and which are still waited for in the preparing of
tea and tobacco.</p>

<p>The kernel of the fresh bean, “Nips”, is white and has a bitter
taste and alternates in colour between whitish yellow, rose and violet;
the mere influence of solar heat is sufficient to produce the brown
cacao pigment, but drying is not so effective as fermentation in
removing the harsh bitter taste and hence fermented beans are
always to be preferred. These have often acquired a darker colour
in the process, their weight is considerably diminished, and their
flavour modified to an oily sweetness, without losing an atom of the
original aroma<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.</p>

<p>Commercially and for manufacturing purposes only the seeds of
the cacao tree are of importance. The root bark is said by Herr
Loyer of Manila to be of medicinal value as a remedy for certain
common female complaints and is employed by the natives of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Philippine Islands as an abortifacient. According to Peckoldt<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the fruit
shell contains a considerable amount of material that yields mucilage
and might therefore be utilised as a substitute for linseed.</p>


<h4>e) Description of the Beans.</h4>

<p>The varieties of the cacao tree which yield the beans at the
present time occurring in commerce are.</p>

<p>Theobroma cacao, Linné the <em class="gesperrt">true cacao</em>, spread over the
widest area, and almost <em class="gesperrt">exclusively cultivated on plantations</em>,
with many varieties (Crillo, Forastero etc.) and Theobroma
<em class="gesperrt">bicolor</em>, a party-coloured cacao tree the seeds of which
are mixed with Brazilian and Caracas beans.</p>

<p>Theobroma speciosum Wildenow, which yields, like Theobroma
cacao, Brazilian beans (magnificent tree).</p>

<p>Theobroma quayanense, yielding Guiana beans.</p>

<p>Theobroma silvestre or forest cacao.</p>

<p>Theobroma subincanum, <em class="gesperrt">white-leaved-cacao</em>, and
Theobroma microcarpum, <em class="gesperrt">small-fruited cacao</em>, <em class="gesperrt">are met
with as admixtures</em> in Brazilian beans.</p>

<p>Theobroma glaucum, <em class="gesperrt">grey cacao</em>, fruits of which variety are
found among Caracas beans.</p>

<p>Theobroma angustifolium the <em class="gesperrt">narrow-leaved</em> and
Theobroma ovatifolium, <em class="gesperrt">oval leaf</em>, may be regarded as characteristic
of Mexican cacao.</p>

<p>Before describing the commercial kinds of cacao, a knowledge
of which is of first importance to manufacturers, it is desirable to
consider the beans in regard to external form and microscopial
structure, in order that the use of some indispensable scientific expressions
in the subsequent description of particular commercial kinds
of cacao may be intelligible.</p>

<p>The bean, page 3 Fig. 2 C-G, consists, according to Hanousek<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>,
of a seed-shell, a seed-skin and the embryo or kernel with the radicle.
The oval-shaped seed is generally from 16 to 28 mm. long, 10 to
15 mm. broad and from 4 to 7 mm. thick. At the lower end of the
bean there is a depressed, flattened and frequently circular hilum
visible, from which a moderately marked line extends up to the apex
of the bean where it forms the centre of radiating longitudinal ribs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>—
vascular bundles-extending to the middle of the bean through the
outer seed-coating back to the hilum.</p>

<p>The outer seed shell (cf. Fig. 3) is of the thickness of paper,
brittle, scaly externally and reddish brown, lined with a colourless
translucent membrane peeling to the so-called silver membrane (previously
but falsely known as seed envelope) and penetrating into the
convolutions of the kernel in irregularly divided folds. The shells of
some of the better sorts of beans, such as Caracas, are frequently
covered with a firmly adherent, dense, reddish-brown powder, consisting
of ferruginous loam originating from the soil on which the
beans have been dried and serving as a protection against the attacks
of insects. But opinions are divided as to, the utility of this process.</p>

<p>The fermented kernel consists of two large cotyledons
occupying the whole bean; it is of fatty lustre, reddish grey or brown
colour and often present a superficial violet tinge; and under gentle
pressure readily breaks up into numerous angular fragments the
surfaces of which are generally bordered by the silver membrane.
The fragments can be easily recognised when laid in water. At
the contact of the lobes there is an angular middle rib and two lateral
ribs are connected with the radicle at the broader end of the bean.
The ripe fresh-gathered cacao-kernel is undoubtedly white and the
reddish brown or violet pigment is formed during the fermenting of the
bean. But there is also a white cacao, though seldom met with.
According to information furnished by Dr. C. Rimper of Ecuador,
it is of rare occurrence and is not cultivated to any great extent.
In Trinidad also a perfectly white seeded cacao, producing large
fruit and fine kernels, was introduced from Central America by the
curator of the Botanic Gardens in 1893.</p>

<p>The microscopic structure of the shell, Fig. III., presents no
remarkable peculiarity that requires to be noticed here.</p>

<p>The delicate inner membrane (fig. 3) coating the cotyledons
and penetrating into their folds consists of several layers. Connected
with it are club-shaped glandular structures, fig. 4, consisting of
several dark coloured cells that are known as the <em class="gesperrt">Mitscherlich
particles</em>. According to A. F. W. Schimper<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> they are hairs fallen
from the epidermis (fig. 4) of the cotyledon and do not originate, as
was formerly supposed, in the inner silver membrane.</p>

<p>These structures, named after their discoverer, were formerly
supposed to be algae, or cells of the embryo sac, unconnected with
the tissues of the seed cells. They are, however, as true epidermoid
structures, similar to the hairs of other plants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>These Mitscherlich particles are not only <em class="gesperrt">characteristic

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.<br />
Cross section of the cotyledon, showing “Mitscherlich particles” (Moeller).</div>
</div>

<p>By addition of petroleum spirit the former, consisting of fat
acid crystals, are dissolved, the latter, remaining unaltered, are considered
by Mitscherlich to be theobromine crystals, since their
crystalline form closely resembles that of theobromine. A more
scientific explanation has not been forthcoming.</p>

<p>The cotyledons are seen under the microscope to consist of
a tissue of thin walled cells, without cavities, lying close together,
and here and there distributed through the tissue, cells with brownish
yellow, reddish brown, or violet coloured contents. These latter
are the pigment cells which contain the substance known as cacao<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>-red
and analogous to tannin; it, together with theobromine, gives rise
to the delicate taste and aroma of cacao. The other cells of the tissue
are filled with extremely small starch granules the size of which
rarely exceeds 0.005 mm.; with them are associated fat, in the form
of spear-shaped crystals, and albuminoid substances.</p>

<p>In order to discriminate between these substances they must
be stained by various reagents. According to Molisch<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, theobromine
may be recognised, in sections of the seed, by adding a drop of hydrochloric
acid and after some time an equal drop of auric chloride
solution (3 %) After some of the liquid has evaporated, bunches of
long yellow crystals of theobromine aurochloride make their
appearance. On addition of osmic acid the fat is coloured greyish
brown. On addition to the microscopic section a drop of iodine
solution, or better iodozine chloride, the starch becomes blue, while
albuminous substances are coloured yellow. Cacao starch granules
are very small and cannot well be mistaken for other kinds, except
the starch of some spices such as pimento or that of Guarana,
prepared from the seeds of Paulinna sorbilis. According to Möller
the blue iodine colouration of cacao starch takes place very slowly
and it is probably retarded by the large amount of fat present; but
the point has been contested by Zipperer and later investigators.</p>

<p>In order to make the starch granules of cacao and the cells
containing cacao-red distinctly visible under the microscope, it is
advisable to immerse the section in a drop of almond oil, because
the addition of water renders the object indistinct in consequence of
the large amount of fat present. Another excellent medium for the
microscopic observation of cacao is the solution of 8 parts of chloral
hydrate in 5 parts of water, as recommended by Schimper.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>By these means it may easily be seen that the pigment or
cacao red in different sorts of cacao varies more or less in colour.</p>

<p>To complete the account of the microscopic characters of the
cacao cotyledon, mention must be made of the small <em class="gesperrt">vascular
bundles</em>, generally spiral, that are distributed throughout the
tissues of the cotyledons and are readily made visible by adding a
drop of oil or a drop of chloral hydrate solution.</p>


<h4>f) The Commercial Sorts of the Cacao Bean.</h4>

<p>Mindful of Goethe’s dictum: <em class="gesperrt">Friend, the paths of
theory are uncertain, and hid in gloom</em>, we propose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
to devote this chapter to an exclusively practical discussion of the
commercial value of raw cacao, and from the merchant’s point
of view.</p>

<p>Such differences of opinion prevail in manufacturing circles as
to the possible uses of each separate sort, that for this reason alone
any other than a purely geographical classification would scarcely
be feasible. But apart from this, varying as it does with the protective
duties imposed, the commercial value of cacao can by no means
remain a universal constant; and it must be noted that variations in
the national taste serve to heighten its instability.</p>

<p>This latter circumstance also causes a deviation from the
nearly related principal that the Motherland becomes chief consumer
of the varieties grown in her colonies. The cacao sorts of the English
Gold-Coast running under the collective name of <em class="gesperrt">Accra</em>, have taken
complete possession of the German market; Trinidad cacao enjoys
immense popularity in France, and the Dutch pass on the larger part
of their Java importations to other consuming nations. As regards
this latter sort, however, the fact they are chiefly employed as
colouring and covering stuffs for other cacaos must be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>In most cases either the producing country or a principal
shipping port gives its name to the different sorts. Yet paradoxical
exceptions will at once occur to the reader. The inferior and mediocre
Venezuelan varieties of the Barlovento district shipped from La
Guayra are generally denominated as <em class="gesperrt">Caracas</em>, notwithstanding
the fact that the capital of the republic Venezuela, situated as it is
1000 metres above sea level (being about 3300 feet), and therefore
quite outside the cacao zone, has practically no connection with the
cacao trade. The collective name, Samana still holds good for the
cacaos of the Dominican republic, at least in Germany, although this
outlet of a tiny mountainous peninsular has long ceased to export
any but very insignificant quantities. Consequently, and rightly,
the French merchant specifies these sorts as <em class="gesperrt">Sanchez</em>, adopting
the name of the principal cacao exporting port of the republic. Arriba,
the choicest product of Ecuador (port, Guayaquil) takes its name
from the Spanish word arriba, above, the plantations being situated
along the upper sources of the Rio Guayas (to wit, the rivers Daule,
Vinces, and Zapotal). Other Guayaquil cacaos are named after the
rivers (Balao, Naranjal) and districts (e. g. Machala) where they are
most cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>As in the case of so many other cultivated plants, distinguishing
characteristics of the various sorts are not only determined by the
different species of tree, but are rather and principally dependant on
the combined effect of physical and climatic conditions. So whether
the seedling Criollo, the splendid Creole bean native to Venezuela,
belongs also to the more fruitful Forastero species (spanish forastero,
foreign), a variety less sensitive and consequently commoner, is a
problem which can only claim secondary consideration.</p>

<p>Apart from the geographical influences mentioned, method
and nicety of procedure are of prime importance in the preparation
of the cacao sorts. Yet technically perfect implements do not always
prove the best means to an attainment of this end; it being a fact
recorded by experience that the chemical constituents of the cacao
bean reach their fullest developement in such simple and primitive
processes as, e. g. are still patronised in Ecuador and Venezuela. It
is scarcely necessary to observe that these simple and primitive
methods postulate nicety and carefulness, which failing, there will be
no lack of defects in the cacao prepared. On the Haiti/Domingo
island, e. g. a variety of cacao is harvested which is in itself very
profitable, as stray specimens finding their way to the market
testify, but which as an article of commerce proves most unreliable,
being generally brought on the market in such an unprepared state,
that fermentation first takes place on the sea voyage, and then of
course only in insufficient measure. During this period appear those
disagreeable and accompanying symptoms technically known as
“Vice propre” and the beans, which were not completely ripe in
the first place, do not develop further, and greenish breakings in
the skin become pronounced, and remain a source of terror to the
manufacturing world. All attempts made in European interests to
bring about an alteration in this deplorable state of affairs have
hitherto been lost on the indolence of the native planters. Indeed,
until the political and economical conditions prevalent among the
mixed Negro population of Haiti/Domingo are thoroughly reformed,
no perceptible improvement can be expected in the qualities of the
Samana and Haiti cacaos, for which reason, with rapidly disappearing
exceptions, there are scarcely any well organised plantations in
these parts.</p>

<p>Turning to the Old World, we find in the West African Gold
Coast a typical example of the possibilities of cultivation on a small
scale, under proper and competent guidance, and with primitive
processes; for not only as far as quantitative progress is concerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
but also in respect to quality, the varieties produced by the natives of
this English colony improve from year to year. Kameroon, a
district which like the Gold Coast has only taken to the cultivation of
cacao of late years, provides us with an exactly opposite instance.
Here the plantation system has been in force right from the commencement
of the industry, with all its technically perfected implements,
yet nevertheless the perfecting of the cacao proceeds very
slowly, and it will be a long time before the produce of this land can
lay any serious claim to specification as a variety for consumption.
Its large proportion of acid ingredient has been above all detrimental,
almost completely precluding its use as any other but a mixing sort,
although some plantations have been yielding comparatively mild
cacaos now for several years. We cannot stay to discuss the problem
of causes in this instance, and whether the fact that the Forastero
species has been exclusively planted prejudices the developement of
the cacao, or the climatic conditions, must remain an open question.
Let it be noted in passing that the Forastero Bean has taken universal
possession of Africa, as well in Kameroon, as in the Gold Coast, on
the island of St. Thomas and also in the Congo Free State. The Bahia
cacao, again, owes its origin to the Forastero seedling.</p>

<p>We will refrain from any further elaboration of this introduction,
however, so as not to anticipate the following review of the
various commercial sorts of cacao.</p>


<h5>f) I. American Cacao Varieties.</h5>


<p class="center">A. Central America.</p>

<p>We begin with</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Mexico</em>, the classical cacao land, scarcely of importance to
the general trade, as the greater part of its entire produce, comprising
about three thousand tons yearly, is consumed in its native country.
Of the other Central American states, next to</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Nicaragua</em>, whose large Venezuelan-like beans find their
way to the Hamburg market from time to time,</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Costa Rica</em> is above all worthy of mention. This state
began to export its home produce in 1912, averaging for that year
about 60 tons; and in 1909, the export had already increased to
350 tons, mostly to England and North America, through the shipping
port called Port Limon.</p>


<p class="center">B. South America.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Columbia.</em> From this republic come two distinct sorts; the
rare, rounded, and native</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cauca</em> bean, which is nearly related to the Maracaibo variety,
and which cultivated along the Magdalena river is in the main
shipped from Baranquille, on the Caribbean sea, occasionally also from
Bueneventura on the Pacific coast; and then the</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Tumaco Cacao</em>, so named from the small shipping port
on the Ecuador border, which resembles the inferior sorts of the
Ecuador coast.</p>

<p>Cauca-and Tumaco-cacaos are only seldom free from defective
beans and worm-eatings, probably less caused by the primitive
processes of preparation than the difficult means of communication
in this country. Then also considerable quantities are retained for
home consumption.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Ecuador</em> is the home of the cacao richest in aroma, the
country which first developed the plantation system on a large and
well organised scale, and which was still at the head of cacao-harvesting
lands a few years ago, with a yearly produce of about
32,000 tons. Yet although it had increased this amount to 40,000 tons
in the year 1911, Ecuador can only take second rank among cultivating
lands, the Gold Coast coming first. The following and most valuable
varieties are embraced under the name of the chief shipping
port.</p>

<p>GUAYAQUIL. They are:</p>

<p>1. <em class="gesperrt">Arriba</em>, i. e. above, these cacaos coming from the upper
tributaries of the rio Guaya (the rivers Daule, Vinces, Publoviejo, and
Zapatol). The Arribas, like the Guayaquil cacaos generally, are
chiefly used in the preparation of cacao powders. They form e. g.
the principal constituents of the Dutch cacao powders, especially the
so-called superior Summer-Arriba, harvested from the month of April
to July. All that is gathered in other seasons falls into the general
class “Arriba superior de la época</p>

<p>The cacaos of the months immediately following on Summer,
the <em class="gesperrt">rebuscos</em>, after crop, are as a rule the most inferior varieties
of arriba, whilst the Christmas harvest of the months of January and
February (cosecha de Navidad) often yields quite excellent sorts.</p>

<p>2. <em class="gesperrt">Machála</em>, second in importance among the Guayaquil
sorts, rather more fatty than the ariba, and differing from this again
in Aroma and the colour of its kernel, which is of a rather darker
brown. Chief cultivation occurs in the low lying land bordering on
Peru and lying opposite the island of Jambeli, where the prevailing
climatic conditions are quite different from those in the arriba districts,
although these are not far removed. August and September are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
harvest months for Machala. Ten years ago this sort was shipped in
large measure from the then newly created harbour Puerto Bolivar.
But since large ocean going steamers no longer call there, it now takes
the more roundabout route via Guayaquil.</p>

<p>3. <em class="gesperrt">Baláo.</em> This variety can be described as a mean between
Machala and Arriba. It has some of the characteristics of both, the
bean being somewhat rounder.</p>

<p>4. <em class="gesperrt">Naranjal</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Tenguél</em> are likewise subdivisions of the
foregoing, except that the bean is here much larger and flatter. As
the production of all three sorts, and especially of Balao, is substantially
greater than what finds its way to the market, we may reasonably
assume that a large proportion is used for mixing purposes,
and sails on commercial seas, as it were, under false colours. Cultivating
district: the Machala district situated along the Jambeli canal,
and the stretch of coast watered by the rivers Balao and Naranjal.</p>

<p>5. Pegados (i. e. stuck together) or Pelatos (balls) is the description
of the cacaos comprised of series of 4-10 beans rolled together,
generally developing from overripe fruit. They experience
a particular kind of fermentation, apparently the result of the fruity
substances still evident, which gives the light coloured kernels a soft
aromatic flavour. For several years these sorts have rarely been
seen on the European market, they being generally reserved for home
consumption.</p>

<p>6. <em class="gesperrt">Oscuros</em>, i. e. dark coloured, a refuse sort rightly viewed
with suspicion in manufacturing circles—Pelotas soaked in water, or
beans left in the clefts and fissures of the drying chamber floors.—The
black shell of the bean encloses a brownish and dirty-looking
kernel, the colour sometimes approaching black: the whole bean
giving a disagreeable impression, as it is often disfigured with mould,
and possessed of a disagreeable odour. For several years this variety
served the “crooks” of the commercial world as mixing material
for the so-called “flavouring” of Machala, but it now again appears
as a distinct sort.</p>

<p>The shipping port for all these cacao sorts is Guayaquil; though
other harbours also handle valuable varieties. Such, for example, are</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">a) <em class="gesperrt">Bahia de Caraquéz</em>, and the small haven of Manta lying
south of this town, which deals in a sort resembling a blended
Machala-Balao, though occasionally light brown in appearance
and of aromatic flavour. This cacao is generally labelled as
<em class="gesperrt">Caraquéz</em> for short, and is to be distinguished from <em class="gesperrt">Caraque</em>,
the French term for Caracas cacao.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>The chief harvesting months are June and July; the
April-May arrivals, however, are usually better, as the setting-in
of the rainy season increases the difficulties of drying. The
harvest in 1909 reached 3,000 tons, and is normally from
2000 to 5,000 tons yearly.</p>

<p class="hang">b) <em class="gesperrt">Esmeraldas</em>, similar to the foregoing, but of perceptibly
inferior output, possesses only a very insignificant yield (about
150 tons a year), and this in spite of the cultivating capacities
of the interior.</p></blockquote>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Peru</em>, the most southerly producing land on the west coast
can likewise only boast of a very insignificant yield, chiefly destined
for home consumption.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Brazil</em>, with its two great sorts for consumption, Bahia and
Para cacao, and a yearly production of round 33,000 tons, has from
the years 1906-1909 far outrun all other harvesting lands. Yet although
it was able to increase this to 36,250 tons in 1911 it must
nevertheless take second place among cultivating lands, the Gold
Coast and Ecuador preceding.</p>

<p>A most important factor on the market is included under the
specification <em class="gesperrt">Bahia</em>-cacao. Here again the shipping port has given
its name to the cacao sort. It is harvested in three southerly situated
districts, Ilheos, Belmonte, and Canavieiras, and is despatched to
Bahia from harbours of the same name, in sailing vessel which sometimes
ship a thousand sacks.</p>

<p>Ilheos despatches the inferior of the two principal varieties
“Fair fermented” and “Superior fermented” that is, the first-named,
and so furnishes two-thirds of the Bahia crop. The cacao areas
in the district of Ilheos are situated on rather high and mountainous
ground, where arresting atmospheric conditions often predominate.
Also the absence of any waterway whatever renders it a necessity
to despatch the cacao to Bahia on beasts of burden, which during
the rainy season can scarcely find a footing on the beaten tracks.
It is, then, the unfavourable atmospheric conditions, combined with
a certain carelessness on the part of the planter in the preparing processes,
which prejudices the otherwise excellent quality of the Bahia
bean, and more especially in the months of June, July and August.</p>

<p>At this period it is no rarity to find from 10 to 20 percent of
waste beans, and in general only the December-February months
offer anything approaching a guarantee as to quality. But here no
hard and fast rule can be adduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>Belmonte and Canavieiras are the districts of the “Superior fermented”
cacaos. The lower lay of the land is responsible for other
climatic conditions, and in addition, both harbours here are situated
at the mouths of rivers which afford an easy and sure means of
transport. So the cacao, which is also better roasted,—a few
planters even drying in ovens—reaches the market in a much better
condition, and fetches at least from 3-4 sh. a cwt. more than the
“Fair Fermented” variety.</p>

<p>In all three districts, the beans are prepared in wooden boxes,
covered with banana skin, in which the Ilheos variety is allowed to
ferment from 2-3 days, and the superior from 2-5 days: this after
they have been well shaken up. In Belmonte considerable drying
takes place on the sand there deposited by the river in large
quantities.</p>

<p>The harvesting is generally reckoned from April 1st. to March
31st. In June and July is the intermediate harvest, whilst the months
from October to February supply the bulkiest crops.</p>

<p>The Bahia district yields yearly about 33,500 tons, a fourth part
of which is devoted to the consumption of the United States, the remainder
chiefly going to Germany, France and Switzerland. The
return is still on the increase, and large stretches of land await
cultivation.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Para</em> cacao is the denomination of all those sorts shipped
from the tracts of land lying along the banks of the Amazon and its
mighty tributaries, more especially from Manaos and Itacoatiara,
through Para, a port situated on the eastern arm of the delta. These
varieties may be classed as intermediary between Bahia and good
Sumana. The yearly yield (harvest months June-August) amounts
to about 5,000 tons, a comparatively small figure in view of the
enormous expanses capable of planting, where the cacao tree at present
grows wild, or at least uncultivated. It is true that the returns
for 1891 reached 6,500; only to be diminished by half in 1908. France
is by far the chief country consuming Para cacao; the sort not meeting
with especial favour in other states.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Guiana.</em> Of the three colonies belonging to France, Holland,
and Great Britain respectively, which go under this name, only the
intermediate one, Dutch Guiana, is of importance in the world’s
cacao trade. It comes into consideration under the name of</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Surinam</em> cacao. The yield, which should in normal years
amount to about 3,000 tons (1899 providing the record with approximately
4,000 tons), has been considerably impaired by tree diseases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and parasites. The return for 1904 only amounted to 850 tons, for
example. But meanwhile Holland had hit upon excellent measures to
battle against the enemies of the tree, and the years 1909 and 1910
had in consequence already improved this to 2,000 tons. The bean
has some resemblance to the Trinidad bean, as far as quality is concerned.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Venezuela</em>, one of the earliest cultivating lands, is the
home of the Criollo bean, and of the most splendid specimens of
bean in general, sorts which play a prominent part in the Chocolate
Manufacture. The Venezuelan bean is rather long and round, and
its kernel of a beautiful light brown, with a mild sweet flavour. Unfortunately
the plantations have recently been interspersed with Forastero
or Trinidad-Criollo trees—called in Venezuela “Trinitarios
because brought over from Trinidad, a species which requires less
attention and bears more fruit, but which just on that account supplies
commoner and mediocre beans, slowly fermenting, and often
developing a violet hue. The preparation is here of the simplest; the
beans e. g. are dried on clay-covered floors, and in rainy weather
earthy fragments often adhere to them. Yet such “Patios” or “Then-dales”,
(clay floors) are only in use on the small “haciendas” (plantations).
The colouring of the Venezuelan bean with an ocre-like
earth constitutes an especial peculiarity. It is adopted in particular
for the medium and finer sorts. The earth is mostly sent from the
neighbourhood of Choroni to the two large shipping ports Puerto Cabello
and La Guayra, where the colouring or “Earthification” of the
cacaos to be exported ensues. The earth, varying in colour from
a dirty yellow to brick-red, is mixed to a thin paste with sea-water,
and afterwards placed in the sun on large sieves, or spread over
cement floors. Where the colouring takes place immediately on the
plantation, the yellowish brown earth everywhere available is utilised;
and where sea-water cannot be obtained, as on the Rio Tuy,
for example, there the beans are coloured with a mixture prepared
from crushed and almost liquid cacao fruits and this same yellowish
brown earth, as the use of fresh water is thought to afford but inferior
protection against mould growths. Such juice-coloured cacaos,
and occasionally also the Ocumare sorts, are often covered with a
rather thick earthy crust. Professional opinion concerning the utility
of this colouring varies greatly. In France, the principal country
consuming Venezuelan cacao, it is still maintained that the thin earthy
crust not only enables the bean to resist the penetration of mildew,
but also admits of a kind of after-fermentation, together with develo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>pement
and preservation of the most valuable constituents of the
cacao bean. Colouring is then the rule for the finer Caracas sorts,
and all varieties shipped through Puerto Cabello; it is also in use
at Carupano, for export to Spain.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan cacaos are divided as follows, and with one
exception take their names from the chief shipping ports, to which
they are brought in small sailing vessels tapping the villages dotted
along the coast.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">1. <em class="gesperrt">Maracaibo</em> cacao, the noble, large, and always uncoloured
bean found on the shore of Sea of Maracaibo.</p>

<p class="hang">2. <em class="gesperrt">Puerto Cabello</em>, quite the finest of all cacao sorts,
with the following sub-classes, each named after tiny harbours
in the vicinity: Chuáo, Borburato, Chichiriviche, San Felipe
(coloured with its own peculiar light brown earth) Ocumare,
Choroni.</p>

<p class="hang">3. <em class="gesperrt">Caracas</em> cacao, exceptionally so-called, although quite a
small proportion, namely that brought over the mountains from
the Rio Tuy district in donkey caravans, now touches the republican
capital. La Guayra, rather, is the shipping port for
the so-called Caracas sorts, to which belong all the cacaos
from the fertile Barlavento district east of La Guayra, a region
watered by two rivers, Rio Tuy and Rio Chico, and with the
following outlets; Rio Chico (which gives its name to the most
ordinary of sorts), Higuerote, and Capaya. The plantations
hard on the mountainous coastal slopes produce a very fine
bean, of equal value with the Puerto Cabello.</p>

<p class="hang">4. <em class="gesperrt">Carupano</em> cacao, a sound Venezuelan medium sort, generally
coming into use uncoloured; the arrivals from the easterly
harbour Rio Caribe also belong to this sort, and also the
cacaos of Irapa, Guiria, and Cano Colorado, often shipped from
the port of Trinidad lying opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <em class="gesperrt">Angostura</em> (Ciudad Bolivar) on the Orinoco
and San Fernando on the Apure, only very insignificant quantities
arrive.</p>

<p>They speak of a Christmas and a Summer (June 21st)
harvest in Venezuela; but the first four months of the year
are generally the most productive. The total produce of Venezuela
amounts to about 16,000 tons, of which as export
there fall to</p>

<p>Trinidad produces a cacao which on many plantations, or
estates, as they are called, receives preparation at the hands of experts,
and is very highly esteemed in commerce, and especially in
England and France. The best and generally slightly coloured sorts
are specified as “Plantation”, the medium “Estates”, after the English
name, and the inferior “Fair Trinidad shipping cacao The bean
“Trinidad criollo” is oval, yet not so rounded as the Venezuelan; its
kernel is for the most part dark-coloured, still brown in the better
varieties, but inky black among the inferior. It is customary in Trinidad
to trade the cacaos as prime specimens and to assign to them the
name of a species which not infrequently furnishes no true indication
of their origin. “Soconusco” and “San Antonio” are particularly high-sounding;
mention can further be made of “Montserrat”, “La Gloria”,
“Maraval”, “Belle Fleur”, “El Reposo” etc. Chief harvest, December
to February inclusive, by-harvest May to August.</p>

<p>The total export from Trinidad amounts to about 22,500 tons
yearly. The substantially smaller island of Grenada, also British,
contributes about 6,000 tons a year to the world’s supply. Owing to
the prevalence of like climatic and geological conditions, the yield and
quality are here the same as on the neighbouring island of Trinidad.
The chief consumer of the Grenada cacaos is the Motherland,
and the same holds good for the small British islands of St.
Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominique, all of little import in the general
trade of the world.</p>

<p>Martinique-and Guadeloupe-cacaos, hailing from the French
islands so named, with a yearly production varying from 5,000 to
7,500 tons, only come into consideration for the consumption of the
Motherland, which affords them an abatement of 50 percent in connection
with the tariffs. San Domingo, the larger and eastern part of
the Haiti island, already contributes about 20,000 tons yearly to the
universal harvest. Especially in the last ten years has the cacao cultivation
here received considerable expansion (yield 1894 2,000 tons,
1904 13,500 tons) and as vast suitable tracts of land are to hand,
this country would justify the highest expectations, if the general
political and economical relations of the double republic and a certain
indolence of the planters, all small farmers, had not to be allowed for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>A methodical preparation only seldom takes place. Processes
are limited to a very necessary drying, as a rule, so that the cacao,
excellent in itself, takes rank among the lowest as a commercial
quality. The chief gatherings occur in the months of May, June
and July. The shipping ports are Puerta Plata on the north-coast,
Sanchez and Sumana on the Bight of Samana, and La Romana, San
Pedro de Macoris and Santo Domingo (the capital) on the south coast.
Tiny Samana, situated on a small tongue of land, and so outlet for
no extensive region, has given its name to Domingo cacao as a
commercial sort, as from here the first shipments were dispatched.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Sanchez</em> cacao, so named because Sanchez, where the
transports come from the fruitful district of Cibao as far as La Vega,
is the chief exporting harbour of the republic. From the same district,
starting at Santiago, there is yet another line, this time running
northwards to Puerto Plata on the coast. The cacao of this
northerly province of Cibao is generally held in higher esteem than
that coming from the southern harbours.</p>

<p>The United States, which have recently developed an interest
in the land for political reasons, have been promoted to first place
among its customers during the last few years; and then follow
France and Germany. It can only be hoped that this influence grows,
in view of the thereby doubtlessly accelerated improvements in
the preparation processes. Up to the present, varieties free from
blame are conspicuously rare. Uniformity as regards the weight
of the sacks has not been possible, owing to the diversity of the means
of transport. Districts lying along the railways, or close to the harbours,
make use of 80-100 kg. sacks (about 176-220 lbs.) But
where transport must be made on beasts of burden, sacks of from
65-70 kilos (143-154 lbs.) are the rule.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Haiti</em> cacao, coming from the Negro republic of the same
name, is the most inferior of all commercial sorts, chiefly on account
of the incredibly neglective preparation which it undergoes, for exceptions
prove that the bean is capable of being developed into a very
serviceable cacao. Beans covered with a thick gray coloured earthy
crust, often even mixed with small pebbles and having a gritty, and
where healthy, black-brown beaking kernel. The “Liberty and Equality”
of the Negros and Mulattos in this corrupted republic are mirrored
in its plantation system, the land being cultivated but little,
and running almost wild. To effect a change in this state of affairs,
that island law must first of all be abolished, whereby every stranger
is prevented from acquiring landed estate in Haiti.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>The yield, about 2,500 tons, is chiefly exported from Jérémic,
then also from the harbours Cap Haitien, Port de Paix, Petit Goave,
and Port au Prince. France and the United States are the principal
customers. The neighbouring island of</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cuba</em> also delivers the greater part of its cacao produce to
the United States, amounting to between 1,000 and 3,000 tons, a fact
explained by geographical, political and freight considerations.</p>

<p>Thanks to its careful preparation, this bean, which resembles
the Domingo in many respects, is preferred, and fetches a correspondingly
higher price. The shipping port is Santiago de Cuba, situated
in the south-eastern portion of the island.</p>

<p>Jamaica, with its yearly harvest of about 2,500 tons, principally
attends to the wants of the Mother Country.</p>


<h5>II. African Cacao Varieties.</h5>

<p>Cacao cultivation in Africa is of comparatively recent date.
The plantations found on the three islands San Thomé and
Principe (Portuguese), and Fernando Po (Spanish), lying in the
Gulf of Guinea, are the oldest. To the first-named island may be
traced much of the impulse given to cacao plantation in other
African districts, so rapid has been its success here, under the
energetic guidance of the skilful Portuguese planter, and the yet
more effective propitious climatic influences and favourable industrial
conditions.</p>

<p>Rare sorts are nowhere to be met with, for the Forastero
bean has conquered the whole of Africa. The sorts produced are
accordingly rather adapted for general consumption. St. Thomas
and the Gold Coast provide a third of the world’s present-day cacao
supply, and in the English colony especially, the geological and
climatic conditions are of such a kind, that the</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Gold Coast</em> might very well become to the raw cacao
market of the future what the Brazilian province, San Paulo, is now
to the coffee trade.</p>

<p>In the middle of the “Eighties”, the Swiss Missionary Society
planted in the vicinity of their station, and so started the cultivation
of the cacao tree now flourishing throughout the land. The first
fruits came to Europe in 1891, and in 1894 already totalled 20 tons.
In 1901 it was 1,000 tons, 1906 approaching 10,000 tons, and the
year 1911 provided the record with about 40,000 tons. It is true
that complaints were long and rightly lodged concerning the inferior
quality, due to carelessness on the part of the natives in conducting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the processes of preparation. But since the year 1909, there have
appeared on the market side by side with the inferior and so-called
current qualities, which still retains more or less of the defects
of the earlier produce, another and properly fermented cacao, in no
mean quantities; it is very popular in all cacao-consuming lands, and
fetches from 2 to 3 shillings per cwt. more than the current qualities.
All this has been achieved through intelligent and sympathetic guidance
and control of the small native planter on the government’s
part, without resource to any large organised plantation system.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Accra</em> cacao, then, as the sorts of the African Gold Coast
are collectively named, also promises to be the cacao of the future,
if it can maintain its quantitative and qualitative excellence. There is
indeed no want of soil and adequate labour strength in that province.
Apart from Accra, Addah, Axim, Cape Coast Castle, Prampram,
Winebah, Saltpond, Secondi must be mentioned above all. The chief
harvest is from October to February.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Togo</em>, the small German colony adjoining the British Gold
Coast, has till now had only a yearly yield of 250 tons in a variety
resembling Accra. The excellent beans prepared on the plantations
fetch several shillings a cwt. more than Accra, whilst the deliveries
of the natives rank below the current specimens of this sort. Its
port is Lome.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Lagos</em>, the British Colony bordering on Dahomey and east
of the Gold Coast, is watered by the Niger and possesses cacao exporting
ports in Lagos, Bonni and Old Calabar, and exports about
4,000 tons of a sort resembling Accra, but nevertheless not so well
prepared and so of inferior value.</p>

<p>The cacao plantations of the Lagos colony,—more properly
known as Southern Nigeria—lie on either side of the great Niger
delta, in low lying land where the climatic and geological conditions
are quite different from those in the neighbouring German
possession of</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Kameroon</em>, in which country steep slopes and the narrow
coastal strip at the foot of the Kameroon range, lofty mountains,
perhaps 13,000 ft. high, constitute the cacao cultivating region. Consequently
the same variety of seed, the Forastero, here produces a
different kind of fruit. The Kameroon bean has its own peculiar
characteristics; although there is some resemblance to that produced
on the opposite islands of Fernando Po, Principe, and St. Thomas;
and the milder sorts from the “Victoria” and “Moliwa” plantations
often do duty as a substitute for the latter variety. There is no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
bean which contains so much acid as the Kameroon, and although
this statement must be modified in view of improvements in recent
years, the fact prevents the largest of German colonial sorts from
serving as any other than a mixing variety.</p>

<p>Cultivation is the rule throughout Kameroon, with the exception
of Doula, and the produce of the separate plantations, such as
Victoria, Bibundi, and Moliwe, Bimbia, Debundscha and so forth, all
of which belong to large Berlin and Hamburg companies, is
influenced and differentiated by variations in the technique of preparation.
There are smooth beans with blackish-brown shells, and others
of a red-brown hue and shrivelled, some with traces of fruit pulp,
and others again quite light-coloured, with occasional black specks
resulting from a too thorough drying.</p>

<p>The chief gathering begins in September and ends in January.
Exportation began in the year 1899 with 5 cwts. The produce in 1898
figured at 200 tons and it had in the year 1910 grown to 3,500 tons.
Germany is of course the principal consumer, although England has
since 1909 bought very much Kameroon cacao as St. Thomas.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Kongo</em> is a bean resembling the finer St. Thomas, but smaller
and often smoky. It comes on the market via Antwerp. Up to
the present French Congo has only produced a few thousand
hundredweights yearly, but the Belgian Congo Free State has
managed to achieve an annual output of 900 tons towards the close
of the last decade; and when this country takes the Gold Coast as
model, perhaps Congo cacao will one day play an important rôle in
the world of commerce.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">St. Thomas</em>, the small Portuguese island lying in the Gulf
of Guinea, and almost on the Equator, produces a sort which enjoys
immense popularity, and especially in Germany, which traces a fourth
part of its consumption back to this island. The export figures are</p>

<p>These are estimates which make the Portuguese planter worthy
of all respect. It is true that “Black ivory” has been utilised on a
large scale, the exploiting of black labour having resulted in a
boycotting of these St. Thomas sorts on the part of some English
manufacturers, but less on account of harsh treatment on the plantations
themselves as the manner of recruiting in Angola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Fine Thomas is the description of those sorts which have been
used in an unmixed condition owing to their indigestibility, but
properly gathered and fermented. The inferior and slightly damaged
cacaos picked out from these are called by the Portuguese planter
“Escolas”, or assorted. Yet they do not come into commerce under
this designation, being mostly used for making up sample collections
which illustrate the difference between these and <em class="gesperrt">Fine Thomas</em>.
The latter is traded through Lisbon “On Approval of Sample</p>

<p>All the St. Thomas cacao trade passes through Lisbon; for the
tariff regulations of the Portuguese government make direct connection
between the island and the consuming land practically impossible.
France indeed chooses the route via Madeira, unloading and reloading,
to avoid the additional duties. The cacao is at Lisbon stored in the
two great Custom-houses there, and prepared for despatch to the
respective lands. Fine St. Thomas is reshipped in the original sacks.</p>

<p>The samples are offered under various marks, either the initials
of the planter or the name of a plantation. We mention a few of
the best known; U. B., D. V., R. O., “M. Valle Flor”, “Boa Entrada”,
“Monte Café”, “Santa Catarina”, “Pinheira”, “Agua Izé”, “Colonia
Acoriana”, “Queluz”, “Gue Gue”, “Rosema”, “Pedroma”, “Monte
Macaco</p>

<p>The beans vary, as far as shell and kernel are concerned,
according to the mode of preparation on the plantations and the structure
of the soil from which they spring. Many which were formerly
universally esteemed are now no longer preferred because the soil in
the meantime has been worked out; and many are now described
under different marks. Yet particular characteristics still continue;
there are mild and strong sorts, smooth and shrivelled varieties which
look as though they have been washed, and others black like the
Cameroon bean. All are offered as Fine Thomas, and enjoy an immense
popularity.</p>

<p>Good <em class="gesperrt">medium Thomas</em> is the commercial designation of
those cacaos hailing from small plantations which have undergone
a scarcely sufficient preparation owing to the lack of proper apparatus,
and which are always interspersed with black or sham beans.
In so far as these are delivered from large plantations, they generally
owe their origin to overripe fruit, probably overlooked in the gathering
season; or fruits bitten by the rats which infest this island may also
contribute such beans. Almost all these inferior cacaos are sorted
in the Lisbon custom-houses, and thinned down to the quality “Medium
Thomas” free from objection or “Good Medium Thomas The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
months of the Summer harvest, July and August, supply a
somewhat better variety of cacao, known in commerce as “Pajol”,
i. e. literally, “Hailing from the country”, which generally fetches a
rather higher price. During the Winter harvest from November to
February the medium St. Thomas varieties come on the market, but
not before the beginning of the year, as previous to that point of time
only the regular harvest of <em class="gesperrt">Fine St. Thomas</em> comes into consideration.
All attempts on the part of consumers to effect an improvement
in the quality of the medium varieties have unfortunately
hitherto proved abortive, for they are regarded as by-produce on
the larger estates, and the small ones do not possess the apparatus
necessary for a thorough preparation. Then again it is seen that these
inferior sorts are taken off the market at very reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Fernando Po, a mountainous island, situated immediately off
Cameroon, may be regarded as a source of supply for the Motherland,
Spain, and only as such, for its yearly output of 2500 tons need fear
no competition, thanks to the excessive tariffs laid on the produce of
other lands here. The qualities here are inferior to those from St.
Thomas and Cameroon, chiefly because most plantation are in the
hands of blacks and consequently not well managed.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">German East Africa</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Madagascar</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Mayotta</em>
(Comoren) and <em class="gesperrt">Réunion</em> with their dwarfish yield are only worthy
of passing mention.</p>


<h5>III. Asiatic Cacao Sorts.</h5>

<p>The only cacao plantations deserving the name on the continent
of Asia are those occurring on the two islands of Ceylon and
Java, both producing a sort differing entirely from the Africans, the
predominant seedling here planted being the Trinidad-Criollo. The
Ceylon-Java bean is, like the genuine Criollo, oval shaped, inclining
to a sphere; its kernel is light brown and among the finer sorts even
whitish. So both varieties are principally used for colouring and
covering the cacao mass, for neither has a very pronounced flavour.
The shell is light brown or reddish brown after washing, and
appears free from all traces of pulp. It sits loosely on the kernel, at
least in the case of the Java bean, and is consequently often met
with broken.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Ceylon</em>, with the shipping port of Colombo, produces in a
good year from 3,500 to 4,000 tons, about two-thirds of which are
traded through London. Direct shipments to Germany have recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
been more and more frequent; Australia also claims consideration as
a consuming land.</p>

<p>The different sorts, or rather, qualities, for a very careful
preparation ensures the excellence of the goods, go under the description
fine, or medium, or ordinary, and occasionally are utilised
as typical examples. The better sorts come exclusively from
plantations, and the ordinary are the result of native enterprise.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Java</em> also produces a large quantity, the cacao here being
chiefly planted on the north side of this long, narrow island. More
than a half is exported from the port of Samarang, then follow
Batavia, Soerabaja and a few minor places, with a total output of
about 2,500 tons. The larger proportion of this cacao is sold in the
markets of Amsterdam and Rotterdam to Dutch merchants, who
pass it on to other consuming countries. England, North America,
Australia, China and the Philippines are the chief customers.</p>

<p>Those sorts coming from the neighbouring islands of Celebes,
Timor, Bali, Amboina and Lombok may also be considered as sub-classes
of the Java; but they do not total more than 75 tons.</p>


<h5>IV. Australian Cacao Sorts.</h5>

<p>Cacao plantation in Australia is still in its early stages. Most
progressive is</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Samoa</em>, which has increased its 1900 export of 30 cwt. to
200 tons at the present time, among which right excellent qualities
occur, culled from Criollo trees. The deteriorated Forastero has also
recently been planted, which we must allow to be more fruitful and
less dependent on careful nursing. The Samoa Criollo bean resembles
the large fine Ceylon variety, except that it has a more pronounced
flavour.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">New Guinea and Bismarck-Archipelagoes</em> can
only claim casual mention as experimentally interested in cacao cultivation.</p>


<h4>g) The Trade in Cacao and the Consumption
of Cacao Products; Statistics.</h4>

<p>Although cacao and cacao products have always been held
in the highest esteem, ever since they first became known in Europe,
yet price considerations long prevented them from enjoying the same
widespread popularity among the lower classes as tea and coffee.
Thanks, however, to the improved means of transport established in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the course of the last fifty years, which has cheapened all exotic
produce, the demand for these wares has of late been more frequent
and urgent, and is reflected in the constantly increasing influx of cacao
on the European markets and the systematic opening out of new
regions to the raw material, just as corresponding extensions in the
factory world contribute towards a reduction in the cost of the
products. Hence cacao may now be described as a luxury within
the reach of everyman. Its diffusion among all grades of the population
may be regarded as a great blessing, for in it has arisen a new
[Transcriber’s Note: a line is missing here]
merely a stimulant, like tea or coffee, but a beverage in the proper
sense of the term, analytically so established.</p>

<p>It will accordingly prove of interest to glance through the
returns in connection with the trade in these goods, their importation
and exportation, commercial values of the same, and the relative consumption
of cacao, tea and coffee.</p>

<p>Such figures are always at hand. The surprisingly rapid
growth of the cacao cultivation, and the manufacture of cacao
products, is e. g. at once apparent in statistics furnished by the
French government. In 1857 the number of 5,304,207 kilos of beans
were consumed there. The importations of the year 1895, on the
other hand, amounted to 32,814,724 kilos, having in the space of
38 years increased more than sixfold. Of this quantity, almost the
half, comprising about 15,234,163 kilos, is disposed of retail.</p>

<p>Turning to the trade in Germany, the cacao industry here and
its consumption,<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> we are again greeted with cheery prospects.
According to the official inquiry, German trade in Cacao products
for the years 1907-1910 is shown in the following table:</p>

<p>These figures, which we quote from the Thirty First Year’s
Report of the Association of German Chocolate Makers, speak
volumes for the recent development of the cacao trade. It is
interesting, in view of recent occurrences, to note the quantities
despatched from the various places. The importations from St. Thomas,
for instance, show a striking increase. They stand at the head
of the raw cacao products coming into Germany, with 239,756 cwts.,
and have pushed Accras down to second place, this variety having
failed to maintain its 1909 lead, for 1910 did not add more than
6,496 cwts. to its previous total of 199,686 cwts. Bahias came third,
then as now, with 128,760 cwts. This order has not always remained
constant, but has suffered considerable deviations in progressive
years. We give below a table showing the chief cacao producing
lands and their imports into Germany between 1900 and 1908.</p>

<p>The consumption of cacao in other civilised countries shows a
corresponding increase, although with occasional divergencies and
astounding relapses. We give the following table (3) to indicate its
progress between the years 1901 and 1908, and to facilitate comparison.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, when making use of this table (specially
in connection with Germany) that the falling off in the years
1907-8 is to be attributed to the abnormally bad harvests and consequent
increase in prices.</p>

<p>The relative consumption of coffee, tea and cacao has also
inclined in favour of the latter as far as Germany is concerned.
According to the 19th. Report of the Association of German Chocolate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Makers, No. 7, the imports which passed through the custom-houses
of that country, and intended for consumption, figured at the following
in tons; though in this connection it is as well to remember that the
German ton is about 50 lbs. less than the English.</p>

<p>From the above columns it will be seen that the importation
of coffee has only increased 24 percent, that of tea 125 percent, but
that of cacao at the surprising rate of 330 percent. A comparison of
the totals for coffee, tea and cacao in the years 1886, 1898 &amp; 1906 will
make the proportions still more evident.</p>

<p>So that whilst in the year 1886 thirty-five times as much coffee
as cacao found its way into Germany, the imports for 1898 were
ten, and in 1906 only five and a half times greater in the case of the
first named article. It follows that there has been a corresponding
increase as regards cacao consumption in Germany. A momentary
survey of the graphs in Fig. 5, which we owe to the kindness of
Herr Greiert, Managing Director of the Association of German Chocolate
Manufacturers, will make this clear to the reader; and the
diagram there illustrates the relative growth of cacao consumption
in Germany, when compared with other countries. On calculating
the quantity of cacao consumed per head of the population, we get
a graph (fig. 6) which puts the rapid increases in this direction at
a glance.</p>

<p>The curve for the last ten years represents enormous advances,
and contrasts with the more even line developed in earlier years.
According to official reports, the average consumption of cacao per
head between the years 1861-5 amounted to 0·03 kg. (tea 0·02 kg. and
coffee 1·87 kg.) but had in 1910 risen to an average of 0·53 kg. per head.</p>

<h3>a) The Cacao Bean Proper.</h3>

<p>Just as the beans of the cacao fruit are included under the
botanical concept “Seed”, so also their chemical constituents closely
resemble those common to every other seed. There are the usual
reserve stuffs inherited from the mother plant, which serve as
sustenance for the yet undeveloped organs, and compare with albumen
in the feathered world. Apart from the constituents incidental to
all plant life at this stage, such as albumin, starch, water, fat, sugar,
cellulose and mineral stuffs such as ash, the cacao seed has two other
components peculiar to itself; <em class="gesperrt">Theobromine</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Cacao-red</em>.
We adjoin a succession of chemical determinations respecting the
quantitative proportions of these substances in the seed, and think
further that we may be allowed to cite the results of fore-time
investigators in this sphere, especially as their work has formed the
basis for all future operations, and again, in view of the doubt which
still prevails in scientific circles as to the “Normal” composition
of the cacao bean.</p>

<p>1) See Table 9 A and Table 10.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The foregoing tables provide us with a general idea of the
chemical constituents of the cacao bean, but their distinctive properties,
both chemical and physical, still remain to be defined, with
which we accordingly proceed, as such data will on the one hand
enable us to grasp how loss may be avoided in the manufacture of
cacao and chocolate wares, and at the same time render intelligible
familiar processes connected therewith.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the following substances occur in cacao in
varying amounts:</p>


<ul><li>1. Water.</li>
<li>2. Fat.</li>
<li>3. Cacao-red.</li>
<li>4. Theobromine.</li>
<li>5. Albumen.</li>
<li>6. Starch.</li>
<li>7. Cellular tissue or cellulose.</li>
<li>8. Small percentages of grape and cane sugar.</li>
<li>9. Mineral or ash stuffs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Like the majority of plants and plant products, the cacao bean
consists of vesicles or cells, closed on all sides and arranged in a
series of layers. They are constructed of cellular tissue or cellulose,
and contain fat, albumen, water, starch, theobromine, cacao pigment,
besides sugar and salts in inferior quantities.</p>


<h4>1. <em class="gesperrt">Water or Moisture.</em></h4>

<p>There is present in the bean from 6 to 8 percent of water,
a factor which bodes well for the proper germination of the seed, as
when this latter is deprived of moisture, e. g. in the course of a too
thorough drying, it speedily decays. Water is still evident in small
quantities even in the largest and almost withered beans, as will be
seen on comparison of the foregoing analyses.</p>


<h4>2. <em class="gesperrt">Fat.</em></h4>

<p>As a constituent at the expense of which respiration is effected,
fat remains one of the most important resources of plant. It has a
twofold excellence in this connection, and firstly as a highly
calorifacient and carboniferous substance, and again because such
a reserve enables the living organism to oxidise with particular ease,
wherefore it is found accumulated in somewhat significant measure
in the majority of seeds. When seen under the microscope it appears
either as round coherent masses, or as crystalline aggregates clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
distinguishable from the rest of the cell contents on treatment with
a solution of osmic acid. The fat in the cacao bean usually amounts
to from 50-56 percent, or one half of the total weight of the shelled
beans; the shell also contains from 4 to 5 percent of fat.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The
unfermented bean has frequently, in addition to its bitter taste, a most
unpleasant flavour, attributable to the rancidity of its fatty contents.</p>

<p>The raw bean contains rather more fat than the roasted bean,
for whilst the one averages from 50 to 55 percent, there is seldom
more than 48-52 percent in the other. The cause of this phenomenon
may be connected with the enrichment of the shells in fat, and in some
instances, as when the beans are over-roasted, is to be ascribed to
the chemical change which the play of burning heat on fatty bodies
involves, when a destructive decomposition of the whole ensues,
with formations of acroleine. Chemically considered, cacao butter
consists of a mixture of so-called esters, or compounds connected
with ether, such as the glycerides of fatty acids, and contains, in
addition to stearine, palmatine, and laurine<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>, the glyceride of arachidic
acid. It was also formerly supposed that formic, acetic and butyric
acids were among the constituents of this ingredient, but the view
has been proved erroneous by Lewkowitsch<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>; similarly, the presence
of theobromic acid alleged by Kingzett<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> has been called into question
by Graf.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Cacao butter is a fairly firm fat of pleasant taste and smell,
which varies in colour between yellowish white and yellow.
When freshly expressed, it has frequently a brownish shade, passing
after a short time into a pale yellow, and turning almost white on
long keeping. The brown colour is due to pigment in suspension,
which becomes sediment in the course of melting, when the butter
asumes a normal colour, referrible to pigment dissolved in the butter
oils, and secondarily to a dissolution of the products of roasting in
these liquids, rather than to any matter in suspension. The pleasant
smell and taste of cacao butter is probably closely allied to the
dissolved substances mentioned.</p>

<p>The fat extracted from cacao by solvents differs essentially
from that obtained by hydraulic pressure, a fact overlooked in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of even the most recent experiments, and which therefore cannot
be too strongly emphasised. Extracted fat is yellowish white, sometimes
approximating to grey, and after having been kept a long time,
the whole becomes tinged with an actual whiteness, which first
attacks the outer surface, and then rapidly progresses towards the
centre in concentric paths, and which is a sign of rancidity. Its fracture
is partly granular, the smell is not so pronounced as that of
expressed fat, being even unpleasant at times, as in the case of
faulty wares (but compare page), and it has a keen taste. Cacao
butter does not, as is generally supposed, keep better than other
vegetable fats, but is equally liable to become rancid, as Lewkowitsch<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
demonstrates. By rancidity is denoted that state of offensive
taste and smell acquired by fatty substances on longer or shorter
keeping and especially when they are not properly stored. What
chemical re-arrangements of the respective constituents this state
presupposes is very questionable; though it appears from the experiments
of Lewkowitsch<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and others<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> that the formation of acids
does not play as prominent a part as the experimenter is inclined to
think, nothwithstanding the marked increase in quantity which may
occur. The primary cause of rancidity will rather be found in the
oxidation products of the glycerine contained in all fats.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of cacao butter varies considerably,
according as it has been expressed or extracted by means of solvents.
White<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> asserts that it can only be determined when the liquefied oil has
been solidified several days. According to Rammsberger the specific
gravity of expressed butter is 0·85; that of butter extracted by treatment
with ether figures at 0·958. Hager gives the normal specific
gravity of fresh cacao butter at 15° C. as from 0·95 to 0·952; stale
butter 0·945 to 0·946, and the same figures have been confirmed by
other investigations, though Dietricht gives 0·98 to 0·981 at 100° C.
The melting point is generally regarded as 33° C.; there is in this
respect, however, a great difference between the two descriptions of
fat. Expressed fat which has been kept for some length of time
melts between 34° C. and 35° C., and these figures remain constant,
so that it is advisable to read the melting point of fat which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
been in store some time rather than that of the fresh pressed product,
and take this as a standard. All other fat shows a lower melting point.</p>

<p>As the melting point of freshly melted cacao butter shows considerable
fluctuation, the liquid fat must be kept in darkness and
cooled with ice for about a week, and the reading should not be
taken before the expiration of this time, as only then is it possible to
obtain any definite and final result.</p>

<p>Experiments on the melting point of cacao butter as carried
out by Zipperer under special conditions yielded the following values;
cf. also Table 12.</p>

<p>These results vary somewhat, but the differences are to be
ascribed to the methods employed and to the manner in which the
observations of different experimenters are carried out. Generally
it may be taken that the melting point should not be under 3° or over
35°C. The fat solidifies between 21·5° and 23° C. (solidifying point).
The fatty acids from the fat melt at 48°-52° C.; they begin to
solidify at 45° C., the solidifying ending generally at 51°-52° C. (see
table 12).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Adulteration of cacao fat, as many experiments have shown,
cannot be detected simply by deflections in the melting point.
Björklund’s ether test,<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> which is very suitable for the detection of
an admixture of extraneous substances like tallow, wax and paraffin,
is carried out as described in paragraph....</p>

<p>Cacao fat, like all other fats, is saponified by alkalis, that is
to say, forms a soap or a chemical compound of the fatty acids with
alkalis such as potash, soda, ammonia etc. On the addition of a
mineral acid to the soap a salt of the mineral acid and alkali is
formed, with the separation of the fatty acid. The fatty acids are
of two kinds:</p>

<p>1. The volatile acids or those which are volatile at
100°-110° C. or more easily with steam than other vapours. These
usually exist only in very small quantity in cacao fat but may considerably
increase in amount in the fat obtained from imperfectly fermented
beans.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>2. The solid fatty acids are such as are fixed, and do not act
in the manner above mentioned: cacao butter consists chiefly of the
glycerides of these acids.</p>

<p>Björklund’s tests will only detect, as has been stated, admixtures
of wax, paraffin, tallow and bodies of a relatively high melting
point. Another method must therefore be adopted to detect fat of
low melting points, as cocoa-nut fat, or liquid oils like cotton seed
and sesame oils. The methods in use in connection with cacao butter
are the <em class="gesperrt">determination</em> of the <em class="gesperrt">iodine</em>, <em class="gesperrt">saponification</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">acid values</em>, finding the <em class="gesperrt">melting point</em> of the <em class="gesperrt">fatty
acids</em>, the <em class="gesperrt">Reichert-Meissl number</em>, and by means of
Zeiss’ butyro-refractometer, its <em class="gesperrt">refractive index</em>.</p>

<p>The iodine value indicates the amount of iodine percent
absorbed by the fat, and is accordingly a measure of the unsaturated
fatty acids. As these latter differ in amount in vegetable and animal
fats, though constant for each separate kind, it is possible by means
of this iodine value to recognise a genuine cacao fat and to detect
adulteration. The determination of the iodine value is carried out
by Hulbl’s<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> method, and according to Filsinger,<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> it is advisable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
let the iodine solution act on the fat for from ten to twelve hours
in diffused daylight. Before determining the iodine value in cacao
fat, says Welmans<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> this substance should be dried at from
100-105°C. to expel the acroleine produced by too high roasting, at
the same time avoiding too high a temperature, as acroleine can
then be very easily reproduced. Filsinger has determined the iodine
value of many varieties of cacao butter with the following results:</p>

<p>Genuine cacao butter shows an average iodine value of from
33-37·5.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>The <em class="gesperrt">saponification value</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Köttstorfer’s number</em><a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
expresses the number of milligrammes of potassium hydrate
required for the complete saponification of 1 gramme of fat, or in
other words, the amount of potassium hydrate necessary to the
saponification of the fat in thents percent. Filsinger<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> gives the amount
as between 192 and 202 in genuine cacao butter, although it usually
fluctuates between 194 and 195. Its determination is the means of
detecting adulterations with cocoa-nut butter and its preparations.</p>

<p>The determination of the <em class="gesperrt">acid</em> value has lately become of
importance, especially since the introduction of the so-called Dutch
Ha cacao or shell butter, which is obtained from cacao refuse and
is often rancid. This value or number expresses the amount of
potassium hydrate necessary to neutralise the free fatty acids in
1 gramme of fat, and it is therefore a measure of the amount of free
fatty acid. As this constant has been variously stated, according to
the methods adopted (Burstyn, Merz), the fact must be taken into
account when comparing the literature on the subject. As the constants
have been determined by two different methods (Merz,
Burstyn), this must be taken into consideration when comparing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
various data on the acid value of fats. Whilst the “Vereinbarungen”
(No. 1, 1897) in a chapter on “Food Fats and Oils” still recognise two
distinct methods in the determination of free fatty acids, as well as
two different ways of recording the results (degree of acidity and
free acid, calculated on the oily acids) there occurs in the supplement
to the recent margarine code for Germany issued by the Chancellor
on April 1st. 1898, entitled “Instructions for chemical research in fats
and cheeses” under c) a dictum that there is only one absolute and
precise procedure in the “Determination of free fatty acids (degree
of acidity) These calculations are based on the Burstyn method,
which we accordingly annex, more especially as it is now in universal
use. It should be observed that the method of preparation and the
age of the beans, as well as that of the fat all tend to increase the
acid value.</p>

<p>The Reichert Meissl value expresses the percentage value of
the volatile fatty acids present in the fat; as already mentioned, they
amount to 1·6 ccm, in cacao fat extracted by solvents. Milk chocolate,
says Welmans, yields a fat having a Reichert-Meissl value
of 2·5, but compare page....</p>

<p>The determination of the <em class="gesperrt">refractive index</em> in Zeiss
butyrorofractometer is of value for ascertaining the purity of cacao
butter, and it serves as a control on the iodine value, for according
to Roques<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> the refractive index and the iodine value stand in equal
relation, so that fat having a high refractive index gives a high iodine
value and vice versa. The refractive index of cacao butter ranges
between 1·4565-1·4578 at 40°C. corresponding to 46-47·8 on the
scala of the Zeiss butyro-refractometer. The use of the latter is
recommended by Filsinger as a preliminary test for cacao butter,
since with a normal refraction it is not necessary to proceed further
and determine the iodine, saponification and acid values, nor the
melting point. In conclusion we annex table 12, where the respective
constants for different varieties of cacao butter will be found
tabulated.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>We have already stated that there is also cacao fat in the
shells, and though it only amounts to some four or five percent,
it has long been the care of experimenters to recover and realise that
little as fully as possible. It is commercially known as Dutch IIa or
artificial cacao butter, and cannot be obtained like the fat of the kernel
by mechanical means, but is obtained by some cheap solvent like
benzene. The traces of benzene are very difficult to hide, and consequently
this shell butter has little commercial value and its manufacture
is unremunerative.</p>

<p>Filsinger<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> gives the iodine value of shell butter as higher than
that of kernel butter, and fixes it between 39 and 40: its acid value,
especially if the fat is rancid, can reach 50-60° Burstyn, i. e. 50 to
60 ccm. normal alkali for 100 grammes of fat.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> If the free acid of shell
butter be counteracted with sodium or magnesium carbonate, the
neutral fat then has the normal iodine value of pure cacao butter,
namely 36·5. In a sample giving an abnormally high iodine value it
is always necessary to determine the acid value, and if the latter
be too high, the fatty acids must be removed, when if the sample be
unadulterated, the normal iodine value will be obtained. It may be
noted in passing that the high acid values occurring in shell butter
may be due in part to the acidity of the benzene employed as a
solvent.</p>

<p>Cacao butter has a considerable commercial value, and is
consequently liable to adulteration with many inferior fats of vegetable
origin. Among these are especially beef and mutton tallow, the
purified fatty acids of palm-nut oil, wax, paraffin, stearic acid, dicka
fat (nucoa butter, possibly) and cocoa-nut fat, as well as the numerous
preparations of the last named, variously known in commerce as
Mannheim cocoa-nut butter, vegetaline, lactine, finest plant butter,
chocolate butter, laureol vegetable butter, palmin, kunerol etc. Other
but less commoner are the sesame cotton-seed, arachidic, margarine
and hazelnut oils.</p>

<p>For the detection of these and similar adulterates, the reactions
and analytical methods described are all-sufficient. Benedict<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> discovers
that the presence of wax and paraffin considerably
diminishes the saponification value, cocoa, nut fat increases it and
lowers the iodine value, whereas stearic acid raises the acid value.</p>

<p>The presence of cocoa-nut fat can also be shown by the etherification
of the fatty acids with alcohol and sulphuric acid, when the characteristic
odour of the ester of cocoa-nut acid occurs. Vegetable
oils, such as almond, cotton-seed, arachidic, sesame and hazelnut
oils, lower the melting point of the fatty acids and raise the iodine
value. Sesame oil is easily detected by Baudouin’s reaction, yielding
a raspberry coloration whilst pure cacao butter keeps a fine yellow
or dark brown. It is possible to detect the presence of so minute a
quantity as 1% of sesame oil, by means of Baudouin’s reaction.</p>

<p>The following table, containing the analytical determinations
of all fatty substances which can possibly be employed in the
adulteration of cacao butter, will serve to facilitate reference to this
subject.</p>

<p>In addition to its use in the manufacture of certain cacao preparations
and for lubricating parts of machinery which come into
contact with the cacao etc. cacao fat is also used in perfumery and
especially in pharmacy for making suppositaries, ointments, etc., but
it is of no importance in soap making. As an edible fat, in the true sense
of the word, like ordinary butter or lard, cacao butter is not used. It
has been maintained by Benedikt<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that when in the form of chocolate
it is as easily digestible in the human organism as milk fat, which is
generally regarded as offering most favourable conditions for absorbtion
in the intestinal canal. The digestibility of both fats varies
from 92·3 to 95·38 percent, and both, in this respect, stand very near
to cocoa-nut fat from which the solid glycerides have been removed,
and to ordinary butter, the former according to Bourot and Jean.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
being digestible to the extent of 98 and the latter 95·8 percent.</p>

<p>Cacao butter is obtained as a by-product in the preparation of
cocoa powder and in every country where cocoa powder is produced
there is always a large trade in the former article. That is, apart
from Germany, especially the case in Holland, where the monthly
supply to the Amsterdam market is so large that during 1899 one
firm alone—Van Houten—had 855 tons for sale. The average
price of late years has considerably increased, and is now about
64-73 cents per kilogramme.</p>


<h4>3. <em class="gesperrt">Cacao-red or Pigment.</em></h4>

<p>The majority of investigators interested in the cacao bean have
assigned its peculiar aroma and taste to the cacao-red which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
develops. As previously pointed out, the young fresh bean is
colourless, the pigment forming later, as can be observed in many
vegetable colouring materials, such as oakand cinchona-red, madder,
indigo and kola-nut red (from Sterculia acuminata). As the later
investigations of Hilger<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> have shown, the fresh colourless cacao bean
contains a diastasic ferment, as well as a glucoside body, which C.
Schweitzer<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> has termed glocoside or cacaonin. The term glucoside
may be noted in passing as including those bodies, the greater
number of which occur in plants, and which by treatment with alkalis,
acids or ferments are split up into an indifferent body and a sugar,
generally glucose. These bodies may be chemically regarded as
ethyl derivatives of the respective sugars. When the ripe, white
seeds are dried, the cacao-glycoside is partly decomposed by the
agency of the above-mentioned diastasic ferment and formations of
grape sugar, pure non-nitrogenous cacao-red, together with theobromine
and coffeine ensue. These substances, and likewise a certain
amount of undecomposed cacao glycoside, can all be detected in the
seed, which has by this time acquired a brownish to violet colour.</p>

<p>The unfermented bean, according to Schweitzer, has as much
as 0·6% unaltered glucoside. Fermentation produces the same effect
as drying, as here again the glycerine is not completely split up,
for the cacao-red, isolated in the ordinary way, consists according
to Hilger of a mixture of pure non-nitrogenous cacao-red and some
glycoside.</p>

<p>The complete decomposition of the cacao glycoside can only
be effected in a chemical manner, by boiling the finely divided and
defatted seeds with dilute acids, a method which has made it possible
to effect an exact determination of the diureides, as the treatment
with acid sets free the totality of their theobromine and coffeine.</p>

<p>Schweitzer regards the molecule of cacao glycoside as an ester
comprised of one molecule of non-nitrogenous cacao-red, six molecules
of starch-sugar and one molecule of theobromine with double-sided
attachment and having the hypothetrical formula C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>86</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Before the appearance of Hilger’s researches, all statements of
a chemical nature respecting cacao-red related to a mixture of a
pure non-nitrogenous pigment and the glycoside, which must in all
cases be preliminarily obtained, before the pure pigment can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
prepared. That can be done<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> by treating the roasted beans with
petroleum ether, which removes the fat and part of the free
theobromine then with water, to extract the remaining theobromine,
coffeine, sugar and salts, and finally with alcohol, to extract the
cacao-red. The alcoholic residue is then quickly dried on porous
plates. The material thus obtained is a reddish brown amorphous
bitter powder, which is scarcely soluble in water, easily so in alcohol
or in dilute alkali, and is reprecipitated by acid from its alkaline
solution. It gives a sublimate of theobromine when heated. When
the substance is <em class="gesperrt">distilled with 5 percent of sulphuric
acid, the added glycoside is completely
decomposed into sugar, theobromine and
the real cacao-red</em>, which latter is represented by the formula
C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>12</sub>(OH)<sub>10</sub>. It appears to stand in near relation to tannin, which
it resembles in yielding formic acid, acetic acid, and pyrocatechin
by the action of caustic alkalis. The pure non-nitrogenous cacao-red,
at present, is of exclusively scientific interest; for practical purposes
only the crude cacao-red, cacao-red glycoside, as naturally existing
in the bean, is of importance. The better and the more effectual the
manner in which the beans have been prepared by fermentation, the
more intense is the formation of the cacao red, especially its localisation
in the cells and cell tissues. This is the reason that the variations
in colour of different kinds of bean and the aqueous extracts which
they yield are so distinct.</p>

<p>Especially is this noticeable in carelessly dried beans, in which
the cotyledon tissue is of a dirty brown or yellow colour instead
of being brown or violet; the pigment here is not restricted to separate
cells but has the appearance of having penetrated into the contiguous
albuminous cells. The bean contains 2·6-5 percent of the crude
cacao-red; it is soluble in alcohol and in ether and partly so in hot
water, and is completely extracted from the bean by weak
acetic acid.</p>

<p>The crude cacao-red can be determined quantitatively by
precipitating its solution with lead acetate, decomposing the lead
precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen and evaporating the filtrate
containing the cacao-red to dryness.</p>

<p>The aqueous extract of the beans, which contains the cacao-red,
is coloured greenish brown by alkalis, red by acids; acetates
give a grey to yellowish colour; tincture of iodine, stannous chloride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and mercurous nitrate give a rose to brown precipitate. Iron and
copper salts produce grey precipitates which gradually become brown
to black. Gelatine solution, containing alum, and albumin give copious
yellow precipitates.</p>

<p>Stains produced on linen by the colouring matter of cacao-red
can be removed by treatment with hot water and finally bleaching
with a solution of sulphurous acid.</p>


<h4>4. <em class="gesperrt">Theobromine.</em></h4>

<p>All those materials which are regarded as stimulants, like
coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco etc., owe their action to peculiar nerve
stimulating bodies, which are present only in small quantity in the
seeds or leaves of the respective plants and are termed by chemists
alkaloids and diureides.</p>

<p>The physiologically active constituents of tea, coffee and cacao
are considered, even up to to-day, by many authors as alkaloids or
organic bases and especially ranked among the xanthine or purine
bases. Recent investigations, however, separate these substances
from the alkaloids in the strict sense and comprise them within a
particular group of urea derivatives under the designation of ureides;
the ureides of tea, coffee and cacao representing two molecules of
urea, they are to be qualified as “diureides</p>

<p>A bitter substance in the cacao bean had already been observed
by Schrader, but Woscressensky<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> in 1841 was the first to isolate the
diureide, theobromine.</p>

<p>Theobromine is found in the unfermented and fermented beans
in two forms; as free theobromine, which has been eliminated from
the glucoside by the ferment in the drying and fermenting processes,
and in combination with glucose and cacao-red as a glucoside, from
which it can only be separated by chemical means.</p>

<p>Theobromine stands in near relation to caffeine, the diureide
of tea and coffee, as will be seen from their chemical formulae—in
which theobromine is shown to contain one methyl group CH<sub>3</sub>,
less, its place being taken by an hydrogen atom;</p>

<p>so that in all, theobromine falls short of caffeine by only one radical.
Strecker<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> was the first to show the relation between the two sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>stances,
when he succeeded in converting caffeine into theobromine
by the action of methyl oxide on silver theobromine for 24 hours at
100° C. Caffeine and silver iodide are then formed and can be separated
by treatment with alcohol, which dissolves the caffeine, leaving
the silver iodide undissolved.</p>

<p>E. Fischer<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> was shown the relation of theobromine and caffeine
to uric acid by artificial synthesis of both substances from derivatives
of both. Fischer, starting with monomethyl pseudo-uric acid,
converted it into 7-methyl uric acid by distilling it with hydrochloric
acid, and afterwards, by treating the lead salt of the latter
with methyl iodide and ether, produced 3-7-methyl-uric acid. That
acid was converted into dimethyldioxychlor-purine by treatment
with a mixture of phosphorus oxychloride and phosphoric penta-chloride,
with subsequent reduction into 3-7 dimethyl-6-amino-2-oxy-purine,
from which, by the action of nitrous acid with loss of the
amine group, theobromine was finally obtained. The synthesis of
theobromine is a brilliant exploit of Fischer’s, and it is quite possible
that at no distant period, when a simple and cheap method of production
has been arrived at, synthetical theobromine will appear
commercially as a rival of the natural product. At present there is
no prospect of this being immediately realised, and cacao shells
from which theobromine is now prepared are as yet in no danger of
displacement by the new substitute, but still serve as a useful by-product
in the manufacture of cacao.</p>

<p>Theobromine and caffeine, like the alkaloids or plant bases,
have a distinct physiological and even toxic action if taken in too
large quantities.</p>

<p>From the experiments of Mitscherlich it appears that theobromine
has a similar action to caffeine, but is somewhat less active
owing to its being less soluble in the gastric juice. Mitscherlich’s
experiments with frogs, pigeons and rabbits show that 0·05 grammes
killed a frog in 40 hours, 0·05 grammes a pigeon in 24 hours, and
1 gramme a rabbit in less than 20 hours. Death resulted in all cases
from cramping of the spinal cord, producing either convulsions or
subsequent paralysis.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments do not detract from the
nutritive value of cacao, since the human organism requires ten times
as much theobromine as rabbits to exhibit the slightest toxic symptom;
in cacao mass containing 1 % not mentioned in discussion; just a head’s up to PP for S&amp;R] theobromine, that would involve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the consumption of 5 lbs. averdupois of chocolate at once, a practical
impossibility. Similar conditions prevail in connection with the use
of tea, coffee, and especially tobacco, where symptoms of poisoning
have been occasionally noticed (the nicotine peril of excessive
smokers) but it would seem that cacao and chocolate are the most
favourably placed of these stimulants as regards such toxic action.
It appears from the experiments of Albanese<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Bondzynski, Gottlieb<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
and Rost<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> that 3 percent of the theobromine administered
passed out in the urine unaltered, whilst on the other hand 20-30
percent of that decomposed in the organism is found again as monomethyl-xanthine.</p>

<p>The larger proportion of the monomethyl xanthine is
heteroxanthine (= 7 Methyl-X) and the inferior 3 Methyl-X. The
excretion of theobromine appears to be closely connected with
the quantity of urine voided, which is especially increased
by the administration of theobromine. Since 1890, as a result
of W. v. Schröder’s<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> observations in 1888, that property
of theobromine has had an extended application in practical
therapeutics; theobromine has been used as a diuretic in kidney
diseases, and, unlike all similar medicinal agents, it exercises no
influence on the heart, a circumstance which essentially increases its
therapeutic value. It can be employed for medicinal purposes, either
uncombined or in the form of salicylate, acetate and certain double
compounds, as sodium or lithium and theobromine salicylate or
acetate.</p>

<p>The double compounds known as diuretin, agurin and uropherin
are freely soluble in water and are therefore more readily
absorbed into the system than pure theobromine, which is only with
difficulty soluble in water. Through the establishment of theobromine
as a medicinal agent, for which we are indebted to Chr. Gram<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
and G. See,<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> cacao husks, hitherto a waste product in the manufacture
of cacao, have become of value for the preparation of theobromine,
in which many of the largest German chemical factories are
now engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>Fluctuations as regards the percentage of theobromine in the
beans are so extraordinary that they can only be ascribed to the
lack of prescribed and definite modes of procedure in fermenting,
which obviously necessitates differences in the resulting products.</p>

<p>Eminger found from 0·88-2·34 percent of theobromine in the
examination of a rather considerable number of commercial kinds of
cacao beans and in the husks 0·76 percent of the diureide: C. C.
Keller<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> has also found it in the leaves and in the pericarp. Cacao
contains 0·05 to 0·36 percent of caffeine.</p>

<p>Theobromine is a permanent white powder, appears under the
magnifying glass as small, white, prismatic or granular crystals.
At first it has only a slightly bitter taste, which becomes more intense
when it is kept in the mouth for some length of time; and indeed,
the bitter taste of the cacao bean and its preparations is mostly due
to theobromine. It sublimes at 220 ° C. without melting. This
phenomenon explains why the over roasted bean, that is, the kernel
of beans which by accident have been heated to more than 130-150 °
C. is poorer in theobromine than the husks. When heated to 310 ° C.
theobromine melts to a clear liquid which re-crystallizes on cooling.</p>

<p>One part of absolutely pure theobromine dissolves according
to Eminger in 736·5 parts of water at 18 ° C., in 136 parts at 100 ° C.
in 5399 parts alcohol (90 %) at 18 ° C. in 440 parts at boiling
(90 %) point and in 818 parts of boiling absolute alcohol. It dissolves
in 21000 parts of ether at 17 ° C. in 4856 parts of methyl alcohol at
18 ° C. in 58·8 parts of chloroform at 18 ° C. and in 2710 parts of
boiling chloroform<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>. Theobromine is partly decomposed by strong
alkalis but by cautious addition of alkalis it forms compounds with
them, which, are readily dissolved by solutions of sodium salicylate,
acetate or benzoate. These double compounds under the name of
diuretin, agurin and uropherin have lately become of therapeutic
value.<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>Sodium silicate and more particularly trisodiumphosphate
according to Brissemoret<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> are great solvents of theobromine. One
and a half molecules of the latter salt can dissolve one molecule of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
theobromine so that in this way it is possible to prepare a solution of
nearly 2 percent. Phenol also dissolves a large quantity of theobromine,
according to Maupy,<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> who has utilised this property for
the determination of theobromine. The defatted cacao preparation
is moistened with water and extracted with a mixture consisting of
15 percent of phenol and 85 percent of chloroform.</p>

<p>Theobromine, like caffeine, gives the so called murexide
reaction when evaporated with chlorine water—forming amalic
acid—and when a watch glass previously moistened with a little
fluid ammonia is held over the last few drops at the end of the operation.
The residue thus obtained has a violet colour, which serves to
distinguish theobromine readily from other plant bases which do
not belong to the xanthine group.</p>

<p>Although theobromine is the most valuable constituent of
cacao beans, the importance attached to a greater or lesser amount
in the beans as a commercial article was formerly much exaggerated.</p>

<p>The investigations of Dragendorff and others have shown that
the value of various stimulants like tobacco, coffee and tea, does
not entirely depend on the amount of alkaloid or diureide but partly
also on the joint action of all the constituents of those articles, and
it is particularly the aromatic bodies which determine their commercial
value. Various kinds of coffee, for example, of inferior commercial
value contain considerably more caffeine than the costly Mocca
beans. The highly prized Havana tobacco ranges lower than the
Sumatra kinds in nicotine content, and the same conclusion with
regard to cacao would probably be correct. In support of this view,
attention may be directed to the following analyses performed by
Wolfram.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Excluding the theobromine in the shells which are not used in
the preparation of cacao, it will be seen from the above table that
the Caracas bean, which is the finest and dearest, has an amount
of theobromine which is only equal to, or even a little less, than
that in the inferior beans from Guayaquil and Domingo.</p>


<h4>5. <em class="gesperrt">Albumin.</em></h4>

<p>On the presence of albuminous bodies in the cacao bean,
varying between 14-15 percent, depends to a great extent its nutritive
value. The albumin in plants, unfortunately, is not to hand in a form
suitable for direct absorption and assimilation in the animal organism,
in fact, only a fraction of it is so available. Before considering the
nutritive value of the albumin of the cacao bean it will be well to
give attention to the general chemical and physical properties of
albumin so far as a knowledge of them will assist in the elucidation
of the subsequent matter.</p>

<p>Albuminous bodies or proteins occur either dissolved in the
sap of plants or in a solid in the protoplasm of plant cells; also in
the form of granular deposits (Aleuron granules<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>). In cacao they are
apparently present in the three different conditions.</p>

<p>The term vegetable albumen, in its more restricted sense, is
meant to designate a protein substance which is soluble in water
and is coagulable by heat. The greater part of the proteid which
exists in the seeds and sap of plants and is coagulable by heat, is
not albumin but globulin, that is to say, it is insoluble in water,
though dissolved by solutions of neutral salts. Whilst many protein
substances in aqueous solution require a temperature of 100 ° C.
before coagulating, or becoming insoluble under certain conditions,
others coagulate at 65 ° C. Concentrated acetic acid dissolves all
albuminous bodies with the aid of heat, concentrated nitric acid gives
a yellow coloration (xantoprotein reaction). Albuminous substances
are decomposed when heated to 150 ° C. developing a dark colour,
swelling up and evolving an offensive smell, finally leaving behind a
difficultly combustible coaly residue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Globulins combine with aqueous solutions of alkalis such as
potash, soda, ammonia etc. producing alkaline albuminates; with
acids they form acid albuminates or syntonins. Both have the property
in common, that whilst they are insoluble in pure water, they
readily dissolve in slightly acidulated or alkaline water, as well as
in weak saline solutions, and are then no longer coagulable by boiling.</p>

<p>Albuminous bodies are converted first into albumoses (proteoses),
and then into peptons by gastric and intestinal digestion or
by hydrolytic decomposition with acids or alkalis, also by the
action of steam under pressure of many atmospheres, as well as
by putrefaction. Albumoses, with the exception of hetero-albumose,
are soluble in water. Peptons dissolve entirely and in that condition
are absorbed by the animal organism.</p>

<p>Albumins are precipitated from their solutions by strong alcohol,
and in that way Zipperer succeeded in precipitating 4·25 percent of
albumin from the aqueous extract of Trinidad cacao, which corresponds
to about 25 percent of the total amount of albumen in
the bean.</p>

<p>The results of his investigation have shown that generally more
soluble albumen is present in the unfermented than in the fermented
bean. Consequently, it would appear that in the finer kinds of cacao
beans, in which very careful fermentation has been carried out, the
albumin, owing to fermentative alteration, is rendered less soluble.</p>

<p>The constitution of albumin is still not sufficiently known,
despite the excellent experiments of E. Fischer on this subject;
generally it is regarded as having the formula:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Accepting a mean formula corresponding to the above figures as
representation of the albumen (namely C<sub>72</sub>H<sub>112</sub>N<sub>18</sub>SO<sub>22</sub>), it becomes
possible to obtain a quantitative determination of this constituent in
the plants in which it is contained. There is, for instance, 16 % of nitrogen
here. Starting from such a standpoint, and determining the
percentage of Nitrogen contained in a plant, and multiplying by 6·25
(i. e. 16 %), the amount of albumen is obtained. For further particulars
see paragraph 4. The albumen in cacao, as previously mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
is in the form of globulin, that is, in a less soluble form. In
cacao preparations which are required for invalids, especially those
with affections of the stomach, it is important to have the albumen
in a more readily soluble condition. Various attempts have been
made with cacao preparations to obtain that result, and later on,
full illustrations and explanations will be given on this subject. First
of all, however, it is desirable to consider the scientific methods
employed to ascertain the relative digestibility or indigestibility of
albumen.</p>

<p>Professor Stutzer<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> of Bonn has been engaged in determining
the action of digestive ferments of the animal organism on
alimentary substances, and has worked out a method by which it
is possible to ascertain the proportion of albuminous substances which
can be regarded as digestible.</p>

<p>The method depends upon the fact that salivary, gastric and
intestinal digestion can be artificially imitated in the laboratory.
But as the salivary secretion only digests starch and is difficult to
obtain, malt diastase, which serves the same purpose, is used instead.
On the other hand albuminous material is only digested by juices of
the stomach and intestines as fresh obtained from the mucous membranes
of the pig or ox. If we suppose an average of 16 percent of
total albumen in cocoa powder, the following results would probably
be given by Stutzer’s method:</p>

<p>Of 16 % of total albumen there are on an average:</p>

<p>As shown by the experiments of Forster<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> however, artificial digestion
does not correctly represent the actual consumption of nutriment in
the human body. <em class="gesperrt">Forster’s</em> experiments, in which cacao powder
was administered to healthy men, gave a much higher value, in fact,
80 percent of the nitrogenous substance was digested, against 65 percent
by Stutzer’s artificial method of digestion. The results obtained
by artificial digestion must therefore be increased in that proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>


<h4>6. <em class="gesperrt">Starch.</em></h4>

<p>Starch is one of the most important constituents of cacao, as
on the starch taken in conjunction with the fat and albumen depends
the nutritive value of the cacao bean. As previously stated, cacao starch
is one of the smallest kinds which occur in the vegetable kingdom;
consequently it can easily be distinguished from the starch granules
of other plants. Owing to their minuteness the concentric rings
showing the stratified structure of the starch granules can only be
distinguished with difficulty under the microscope. Cacao starch
consists usually of globular granules, generally separate, but sometimes
in aggregations of two or three. The appearance under the
microscope of the starch granules is clearly shown in fig 7, which
represents a section of Ariba cacao enlarged 750 times.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Cacao starch has the usual properties of ordinary kinds of
starch, namely:</p>

<p>1. <em class="gesperrt">It is gelatinised by hot water</em>, that is to say, the
water penetrates between the layers of starch granules, separating
them and causing by its penetration a swelling up of the
starch whereby a transparent mass know as “starch paste” is produced. It
has been supposed that cacao starch is less easily gelatinised than
the starch of other plants. According to investigations of Soltsien’s<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
which Zipperer unreservedly endorses, this is not the case, for under
certain essential conditions, cacao starch gelatinises just as readily as
other kinds of starch.</p>


<p><em class="gesperrt">The blue coloration of starch with iodine.</em></p>

<p>This is said to take place more slowly with cacao than with
other starches, though we have always found that once the cacao
starch is gelatinised, a blue coloration appears immediately on
adding a sufficiently strong solution of iodine.</p>

<p>There are certainly other materials in the cacao bean, such as
fat, which by more or less enveloping the starch, prevent access of
water to the starch granules and thus hinder gelatinisation; or again,
the albumen and cacao-red may exert some retarding influence on the
iodine reaction, <em class="gesperrt">especially if the iodine solution used
is very dilute</em>. Yet it is impossible to describe the reaction
as slow.</p>

<p>According to Soltsien, if a mixture of two parts of cacao bean
with one part of calcinated magnesia and water is heated, a clear-filtering
decoction is obtained, which immediately assumes the blue
colour on addition of iodine solution. On neutralising the filtrate
with acetic acid, and adding 3-4 parts of strong alcohol, its starch
is precipitated.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">By boiling with dilute acids as well as by
the action of ferments like the saliva, diastase</em>
etc., <em class="gesperrt">starch is converted into starch sugar</em>
(<em class="gesperrt">glucose</em>, <em class="gesperrt">dextrose</em>). The empirical formula for starch is
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, that for starch sugar is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, so that in the conversion
one molecule of water is introduced, wherefore its chemical nature is
greatly changed, and especially in its becoming freely soluble in
water. That alteration allows of starch being quantitatively determined,
as the dextrose thus produced has the property of reducing an
alkaline solution of copper sulphate (known as Fehling’s solution,
after the discoverer); that is to say, the copper sulphate is converted
into insoluble red cuprous oxide. As dextrose always precipitates a
definite amount of cuprous oxide, the quantity of starch present can
in that way be determined.</p>

<p>The chemical determination of starch is only in a limited degree
effectual in the recognition of an admixture of foreign starch in cacao
preparations. If more than 10-15 percent of starch (calculated on the
crude bean) has been found, then it must be assumed that there has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
been an admixture of foreign starch, but chemistry affords no means
by which foreign starch can be distinguished from the genuine starch
of the cacao bean. For that purpose the foreign starch must be minutely
observed under the microscope, which not only serves to
detect its presence, but gives an approximate estimation of the amount
present, and its origin. Great caution should be exercised, or the
result may be easily exaggerated.</p>


<h4>7. <em class="gesperrt">Cellulose or crude fibre.</em></h4>

<p>We have already made the acquaintance of this material as the
chief constituent of the cell walls and vascular tissues. Recent chemical
investigations have shown that it consists of the anhydrides of
hexose and pentose (sugar compounds) incrustated with many
impurities, such as cacao-red, gum, mucilage etc. From a chemical
point of view, cellulose has the same formula as starch, viz. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,
or one of its multiples represented in formula. One of its chemical
properties is solubility in ammonio-cupric sulphate, and affinity for
alkalis such as potash, soda, ammonia, causes it to swell when they
act on the cell fibres.</p>

<p>Weender’s process<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> as worked out by Henneberg is the one
usually adopted for the determination of crude fibre in plants,
although recently H. Suringar, B. Tollens<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and more particular König<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
have pointed out that in Weender’s process the so-called pentosan,
that is to say, the sugar-like constituent of the composition C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,
which comprises a not inconsiderable portion of the crude fibre, undergoes
a disproportionate alteration, so that the analytical results thus
obtained can by no means give an accurate representation of the
amount of cellulose. The crude fibre must therefore be treated in such
manner as to eliminate the pentosan. For this purpose the various methods
of König, Matthes and Streitberger have been proposed, to
which we shall return in Book 4. Filsinger, the meritorious experimenter
on the subject of cacao, has by König’s method determined
the amount of crude fibre in a series of different varieties of cacao
bean, and obtained the following results as regards shelled and
roasted beans.</p>

<p>These new values may be provisionally regarded as normal.
From these results not only can an idea of the functioning of
the cacao shelling machine be obtained, but also the presence
of any occasional admixture of husk in cacao preparations
may be inferred, since the husk contains a great deal more
crude fibre than the kernel. Therefore the determination of the crude
fibre is an important item in the testing of cacao preparations, as there
is no doubt that the presence of vegetable substances rich in crude
fibre can be detected by the increase in the amount of cellulose.</p>


<h4>8. <em class="gesperrt">Sugar and plant acids.</em></h4>

<p>The presence of glucose in raw cacao beans was first pointed
out by Schweitzer<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>. The sugar is formed by the action of the cacao
ferment on the glucoside cacaonin during the processes of drying and
fermentation. In addition to sugar, malic and tartaric acids have been
observed. These substances, however, are only of interest to the
plant physiologist and not to the manufacturer, so it is sufficient
merely to notice them here in passing.</p>


<h4>9. <em class="gesperrt">The mineral or ash constituents.</em></h4>

<p>When cacao beans are ignited, the constituents of an organic
nature are volatilised and only the non-volatile or inorganic con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>stituents
remain behind. These consist of potash, soda, lime, iron magnesia,
combined with silicic acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid and
chlorine.</p>

<p>The amount of ash in raw and shelled cacao beans varies from
3-4 %. Tuchen<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> found 2·9-3 %, Trojanowski<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> 2·08-3·93 %, Zipperer<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
2·7-4 %, L’Hote<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> 2·2-4 %, H. Beckurts<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> 2·20-3·75, J. Hockauf<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
2·84-4·4 percent. Of those kinds which are now most in use,
Ceylon gave 3·30 percent, Java 3·20 and Kameroon 2·95 percent.
(Beckurts).</p>

<p>Quantitative analyses of the ash of the cacao beans have been
made by several investigators, and the following table gives a series
of the most complete analyses, made by R. Bensemann<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>.</p>

<p>In previously describing the aleuron granules of the cacao bean
it was mentioned that they contain a comparatively large globoid.
According to Molisch<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>, when sections are cautiously heated on platinum
foil, these globules are found in the ash. From their number
they give a characteristic appearance to the ash of cacao beans, and
thus may serve as a good means of identifying cacao, since they can
be detected in the smallest quantity of a genuine cacao preparation.</p>

<p>A noteworthy fact may here be mentioned, namely the presence
of a rather small amount of copper in the ash of cacao beans as
well as the husks. Duclaux<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> was the first to point out this fact, which
several other observers, such as Skalweit<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and Galippe<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> have also
confirmed. The amount of copper in the husk varies from 0·02 to
0·025 percent and in the beans from 0·0009-0·004 percent (Duclaux).
Copper in similar amount is found in all kinds of beans and husks,
and its presence is due to the absorption of copper by the plant from
the soil, whence it gradually accumulates in the fruit.</p>

<p>b) The Cacao Shells.</p>

<p>Most of the constituents which exist in the cacao kernels are
also to be found in the husks and the methods for isolating and determining
them are the same in both cases. The composition of the
husk, according to Laube and Aldendorff<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>, is as follows:</p>

<p>As evidenced in the preceding examples, data as to the constituents
of the cacao husk deviate considerably with different
authors. Laube and Aldendorff, for instance, found 14-20 percent,
while Zipperer obtained 12-18 percent of husks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>These discrepancies are mainly due to adhering sand and
ferruginous earth collected during the drying and fermenting processes.
If the beans are carefully collected and kept free from earthy
substances, the percentage of husks as against that of the bean will
appear much lower; it is, indeed, now possible to obtain properly treated
beans which contain on an average only some 10 percent of
husks, such as Ariba and Machala. The husks of these two varieties
are exceedingly woody, and their amount sometimes reaches 15 per
cent. The latest machinery for cleaning the beans effects so complete
a separation of the husks from the kernel that very little of the former
remains in the finished cacao preparation (less than 1 percent in thin-shelled
beans and no more than 2 percent in thick-shelled beans such
as Ariba). For some years it was not possible to effect so thorough
a removal of the husk, so that there was always found an appreciably
large amount of shells in the finished preparations, which rendered it
difficult to detect adulteration. As, however, the quantity of ash present
in the husk is double that in the kernel, it was possible to form
an opinion as to the intentional admixture of shells from the increase
of ash in cacao preparations. Hence the ash was always required
to be determined when adulteration was suspected. Under existing
conditions the addition of a quantity of shells sufficient to increase the
percentage of ash present in the powder or chocolate is scarcely
practicable, so that, for the purpose of detecting small additions,
other methods must be resorted to, such as the estimation of the crude
fibre or silica in the ash<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> with the aid of the microscope, in which it
is possible to easily distinguish the forms of the cotyledon (kernel)
mass and those of the husk. The diagram on page 14, Fig. 3, clearly
shows the elementary forms of the cacao husk as represented by
Mitscherlich. It illustrates a longitudinal section of the husk of Bahia
beans, enlarged about 500 times, with six different cell elements in
alphabetical order. First the compressed cells of the epidermis are
to be seen on the exterior, in several parallel series and succeeded
by moderately broad and thin-walled cellular tissue of the parenchyma,
which sometimes presents large empty spaces (sch) the results
of the loosening of the cell walls through the formation of mucilage.
This cellular tissue (lp) is also permeated by bundles of spiral
vessels (gfb), which, with the dry cells, are characteristic of the husk,
as they exist only in very small quantity in the kernel. Then follow
parallel rows of cells (lp) resembling epithelial cells; next comes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
layer of cells with thick walls, the dry cells (st) and finally several
rows of elongated ones (lp). The silver membrane (is) interposes
between the husk and the kernel, fragments of which remain adhering
to the shell after separation of the latter.</p>

<p>To conclude, we find that the husk of the cacao bean consists
of the inner coat of fruit, called endocarp and other parts of the fruit
covering, as well as the skin of the seed<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>. The following layers may be
distinguished;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="hangsection">
<p>1. The pulp, (f in fig. 3) fragile large cells with frequent hiatus;</p>

<p>2. the <em class="gesperrt">endocarp</em> (fe), a single layer of fragile, very narrow
and irregularly arranged cells, but <em class="gesperrt">without hiatus</em>;</p>

<p>3. the <em class="gesperrt">epicarp</em>, or skin (se), polygonal and extended cells,
with an outer wall of some thickness.</p>

<p>4. the <em class="gesperrt">parenchyma</em> or cellular tissue (lp), consisting of
large and multiform cells, with vascular bundles (gfb), the
large mucilagenous or slime cells (sch) and</p>

<p>5. the <em class="gesperrt">sklerogenous or dry cells</em> (st), a single layer
of vessels shaped like a horseshoe, and thickening towards
the interior, and in conclusion</p>

<p>6. the <em class="gesperrt">silver membrane</em> (is), belonging to the earlier
inner coat of fruit, and consisting of two single rows of fat-bearing
cells.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>In examination of the husks of the plane surface enlarged 160
times (fig. 8), it will be noticed that the characteristic epidermis (ep)
consists of large and rather elongated but irregular polygonal cells.
Frequently on the epidermis may be remarked a delicate network
of the cells constituting the fruit pulp (p). Beneath the epidermis lies
a very delicate transverse cellular layer (qu) followed by the parenchyma,
as already stated. The remaining elementary forms are not
readily observed on a plane surface but only in section, though we
adjoin a few diagrams, showing the layers as isolated from the pericarp;
namely, fig. 9 parenchyma, a layer of sklerogenous cells, fig. 10,
and the silver membrane (is) with two superjacent Mitscherlich particles
(tr) in fig. 11.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>For microscopical examination, the husk must first be defatted
with petroleum or ordinary ether and then treated with dilute chloral
hydrate (8: 5) to assist the definition of the forms. An approximate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
estimation of the amount of husk in a cacao preparation can
be made by means of the microscope, adopting Filsinger’s<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> levigation
method, which consists of concentrating those elements of
the cacao which are seldom seen even in suspension in
water, and which sink to the bottom when repeatedly stirred in that
liquid. To these belongs first of all the husk, and its presence and
determination in the levigation method is accordingly greatly facilitated.
The details of the method will be further described in treating
of husk admixtures in cacao preparations.</p>

<p>Cacao shells are the only by-product in the cacao industry,
and have been developed and exploited to such an extent, that a
rational utilisation of the ever increasing quantities has become a
matter of urgent necessity. They are not used in our industry, for an
admixture of husk is not permissible, even in the inferior kinds of
chocolate or cocoa powder, but must be regarded as an adulteration.
It is true that they have been brought on the market as cocoa
tea, and again, have been coated with sugar, to make them
tasty; and to this day, candied husks constitute a favourite sweetmeat
of the population of East Germany. But in this way only comparatively
inferior quantities of the by-product were absorbed, and consequently
projects of all kinds have been suggested to use up larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
percentage. As we have seen, the fatty contents of the bean can be
extracted with benzine, and there is a resultant 4 or 5 percentage of
fat of inferior value, which is commercially known as “Dutch IIa Cacao
Butter”; the defatted shells can be further used for the preparation of
theobromine, as Zipperer has already noted in the first edition of
this book.</p>

<p>Kathreiner’s successors in Munich<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> employ an extract of cacao
shells prepared with hot water, in order to improve coffee berries
during the roasting and to give a flavour to the coffee substitutes prepared
from corn and malt. Cacao extract is also prepared from the
shells<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> by first treating them with water or steam, and afterwards
extracting with water, and finally evaporating as far as necessary.
The thick extract thus prepared contains theobromine, and is intended
for use either alone or as an addition to cacao powder and chocolate.</p>

<p>Strohschein in Berlin<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> prepares from the shells a thick liquid
extract which he calls “Martol Its preparation was suggested by
the fact that the cacao husk gives evidence of containing a considerable
amount of iron. In “Martol”, the iron occurs as a tannate,
and the preparation further contains theobromine, carbohydrates, and
phosphoric acid. The preparation is said to be used as a medicinal
remedy in chlorosis, yet has scarcely justified such a statement.</p>

<p>Alfred Michel of Eilenberg<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> utilises the shells in the preparation
of a brown colouring material. The husks, free from impurities, are
first soaked in soft water, with or without the addition of sulphuric
acid, then washed and finally treated with a strong 35 % solution of
caustic soda. From the alkaline solution, the colouring matter is
precipitated with acid or acid metallic salt, collected on a filter, and
again washed. Thus obtained, it is a dark reddish-brown paste,
possessed of a vitreous fracture. The yield of colouring matter is from
20-25 % of the weight of the original shells. By re-treatment with
alkali, the paste can be again obtained in solution and can be used as
required, either in liquid or paste form. The colouring matter can be
obtained in different tints, either by soaking the shells in more er less
dilute sulphuric acid, or by precipitation from the alkaline solution at
various temperatures, or yet again, by the addition of metallic oxides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>Boussignault<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> says that in Paris briquettes have been made
from cacao shells, and twenty-two years ago, Zipperer<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> proposed to
use them as fodder, especially for horses. Experimental work in that
direction was instituted, but for various reasons, had to be abandoned.
The question as to a rational working up of the husk of the cacao
bean is once more receiving special consideration, more particularly
since the publication by the “Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers”
of a prize essay on the subject. The fodder value of the
husks as determined by Märcker is apparent from the following
figures:</p>

<p>Feeding experiments which were carried out in certain agricultural
institutes showed that the cacao husk stands in nutritive
value between good meadow hay and wheaten bran, and is not only
a fattening fodder for oxen, but also a valuable feeding material for
cows and deer<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>. These results have been confirmed by Prof.
Feruccio Faelli in Turin<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>.</p>

<p>The advantages of cacao shells as fodder, when a comparison
with bran is established, are at once apparent. Two hundredweight
(that is to say, about 220 lbs. averdupois) cost only from six
to seven shillings, whilst the price of bran varies between nine and
ten shillings. The husks also keep better, for after having been stored
eighteen months, Professor Faelli found that they had undergone no
alteration, whilst on the other hand bran had become sour.
A further advantage possessed by the husk is that it will absorb four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
times its weight of water against three times absorbed by bran.
Cattle not only readily get accustomed to the fodder but subsequently
take to it with eagerness. The best results were obtained with Dutch,
Swiss and Parmesan milch cows. After 10 days feeding the butter and
milk-sugar had increased, as well as the daily average yield of milk
from 44 to 49·5 kilogrammes. As soon as the feeding with cacao husk
was discontinued the yield of milk decreased. Faelli concludes that
cacao husk, which can be used as a fodder up to 4 kilog. daily, exercises
a very favourable influence on milch cows, and he purposes to
continue the investigation with horses.</p>

<p>In a report on the Experimental Farms of Canada 1898,
page 151, reference is made to the manurial value of the husks in
enriching the soil with nitrogen and potash, a fact which had already
been pointed out by Boussignault.</p>

<p>The future use of the husks appears therefore to be ensured, and
it is to be hoped that it will allow of a permanent consumption of this
by-product.</p>

The Manufacture of Cacao
Preparations.</h2>


<h3 id="A_Manufacture_of_Chocolate">A. Manufacture of Chocolate.</h3>


<h4>The Preparation of the Cacao Beans.</h4>

<p>Up to the end of the eighteenth century the manufacture of
chocolate was carried on entirely by hand, a method at once laborious
and inefficient. The workman used to kneel down on the ground, and
crush the beans in iron mortars. It was not until 1732<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> that Buisson
introduced the use of a bench and so rendered that inconvenient and
unwholesome practice unnecessary. Even to-day, the Chinese cooks
on the Philippine islands carry their chocolate “Factory” about with
them, in which the trestle is essential. It further comprises a small
marble mortar and warmed pestle, and by means of these utensils and
implements the hulled beans are pounded, and the triturated mass so
obtained spread out. It is then flavoured with sugar and spices. With
that exception, hand labour in the chocolate manufacture has since
the year 1778 been entirely displaced by machinery, when Doret
exhibited the first specimen before the medical faculty of Paris.
According to Belfort de la Roque,<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> a Genoese named Bozelly had
already constructed a mill by means of which he was able to prepare
from six to seven hundred pounds of chocolate daily, comparing
favourably with the thirty pound output yielded by hand labour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Pelletier<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>, in 1819, describes a machine for the mechanical preparation
of chocolate of his own construction, capable of doing the work of
seven men. The machines used in the chocolate manufacture have
since that time been repeatedly improved and re-constructed, although
always with this one end in view, namely to obtain a fine even cacao
mass, and afterwards mix it as thoroughly as possible with the other
ingredients employed.</p>

<p>The first machines of the modern type were constructed by the
Parisian mechanic George Hermann (1801-1883) in the year 1830, to
which inventor we are indebted for the principle of fine grinding with
varying velocities, on which manufacture of chocolate is based
to-day. There is at the present time a rather large circle of manufacturers
engaged in the putting together of special machines for the
preparation of cacao and cacao products, chocolate apart.</p>

<p>Whether chocolate manufacture be carried out on a large or
small scale, it always involves the subjecting of the cacao bean to
a regularly succeeding series of operations, before the resulting
product known as “Chocolate” (in the strict commercial sense of
the term) can be obtained.</p>

<p>The respective operations succeed each other as follows:</p>

will now proceed to describe in more detail, following the headings

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>




<h4>1. Preparation of the Beans.</h4>


<h5>1. <em class="gesperrt">Storing</em>, <em class="gesperrt">cleansing</em> and <em class="gesperrt">sorting</em>.</h5>

<p>Right up to the moment when they are to be used in the
manufacture, the raw cacao beans must be kept as originally packed,
and stored in an airy sun-lit room; although if they have accumulated
moisture during transport or sustained any manner of damage in
harvesting, they should then be emptied out of the sacks, spread out
over the floor of such a room as above described, and dried as
effectively as possible. It has also been recommended that such beans
be washed with a dilute solution of caustic potash (1 in 5000), and
afterwards dried rapidly.</p>

<p>Unfermented beans, those damaged in the harvest, and those
which have received no proper fermentation, develop a greyish
white colour with occasional tints of violet and an unpleasant, bitter
herbal flavour, properties which unfortunately penetrate to the resulting
cacao products. Attempts have been made to meet this evil
with a so-called “Secondary Fermenting Gordian<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> proposes in
this connection that the beans be filled in water-butts, and steeped in
warm water for at least 48 hours (so that obviously the butts must
be kept in a warm room), at the expiration of which time it can be
poured off, and the beans dried in a chamber heated to a temperature
of between forty and fifty degrees centigrade. There is said to
ensue an appreciable improvement as to flavour and colour, when
this process is carried out.</p>

<p>The magazines in which cacao beans are stored have sometimes
an unwelcome visitor, to wit, a grub which according to W.
Hauswaldt<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> happens to attack just the best kinds of Caracas and
Trinidad. As eggs of the grub have on several occasions been
found on the interior of the still unshelled bean, we may assume
that they were deposited by a butterfly (species unknown, but
possibly Ephestia cahiriteller, cf. von Faber loc. cit. page 335) either
before or immediately after fermentation, and no later. Sometimes
these grubs appear on the surface of the sacks, which they
overspread in a few days. Removal of the infected packages, opening
the sacks, and exposure to the sun, as well as a thorough cleansing
of the storehouses, is attended with a qualified amount of success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
The best plan is to destroy the moths during their period of activity
in the summer months June, July, and August.</p>

<p>According to Hauswaldt, Stollwerck<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> and G. Reinhardt<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>, this
can be effected by placing in the store rooms large, shallow basins
of water, near which burning petroleum lamps are introduced on the
approach of dusk, favourably placed on a pile of bricks and stone,
so that they clearly illuminate the reflecting water. The moths
assemble round the light en masse and either perish in the water or
flame, a fate which sometimes overtakes even the larvae, for they
display the same fatal attraction for any light, real or apparent. The
water must be changed every day, as otherwise the wing-dust
collecting on its surface affords a means of escape to the insects
coming later. As the weather becomes cooler, the doors and windows
of the store-rooms should be left open, so that when frost sets in,
the rest of the maggots may be destroyed.</p>

<p>The cleansing and sorting of the raw cacao bean is the most
important factor in the manufacture of chocolate, and yield a
manifold return, for inferior and cheaper kinds of bean which have
passed through these processes can be advantageously mixed with
finer varieties. The chief object of cleansing and sorting is the
removal of foreign bodies and such chance admixtures as sand,
pebbles, and fragments of sacking, which are liable to damage the
stones used in grinding at a later stage of the preparation, or communicate
an unnatural and disagreeable smell to the subsequent
roast products. These admixtures are so multiform and various that
they cannot be removed solely by the aid of machinery, but must
be finally picked out by hand. Mechanical appliances are limited to
the removal of pebbles, dust, and possible fragments of iron, after
which preliminary cleaning the beans are thrown on straps, where
they can be picked by hand. The collector of these foreign bodies
would find himself with a rather interesting stock at the end of a few
years, as Wilhelm Schütte-Felsche points out.</p>

<p>The cleansing of the raw beans was formerly carried out in so-called
roller casks, placed horizontally, and revolving round an axle
fitted in the floor, whence it passed upward, cutting them slantwise.
In this apparatus the beans were rolled and vigorously rubbed
together, and afterwards the hand-picking succeeded. More recently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the roller casks have been displaced by rotary cylindrical sieves,
driven by motor power.</p>

<p>Such a machine is illustrated in fig. 12. The beans are lifted
to a rotatory cylindrical sieve by means of an elevator, where they
are freed from dust and dirt; in other sections of the sieve fragments
of blossom, sacking, or cloth are isolated, whilst occasional splinters
of iron are removed by a large magnet. So prepared, the beans are
cast on running belts, and here the hand-picking above-mentioned is
carried out.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 shows a cleansing machine for the same purpose, which
has recently become rather popular. Here the dust passing from the
sieve is sucked up into a dust chamber, by means of an exhauster,
whilst pebbles, blossom fragments, and small beans are separately
isolated. The cleansed beans pass likewise under magnetic influence,
which removes traces of iron, and finally succeed to the running
belting.</p>

<p>Often the beans are introduced into an extensive brushing
machine before roasting, to cleanse them from dirt etc. These are
generally found in such factories as have circular and cylinder
roasters with direct heating apparatus. Fig. 13 a shows such a
brushing machine for cacao beans.</p>


<h5>2. <em class="gesperrt">Roasting the Beans.</em></h5>

<p>The cleansed and sorted beans are now subjected to a high
temperature, that is to say, they are now roasted. This roasting
answers many purposes;</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1. The aroma and flavour of the bean is so developed.</p>

<p>2. The starch granules are gelatinised.</p>

<p>3. The herbal constituents are so transformed that the flavour of the
beans becomes milder; a distinct improvement.</p>

<p>4. In the consequent drying, the shells are rendered brittle, and more
easily removeable.</p>

<p>5. The beans themselves can afterwards be better ground.</p></div>

<p>The roasting of the cacao bean does not demand so high a
temperature as that of coffee, to effect the above chemical and
physical changes. Experience has shown that the best temperature
lies between 130-140 ° C., though deviations from this standard
have recently become frequent and considerable, according to the
uses for which the cacaos are intended, and roasting has sometimes
taken place at a temperature even as low as 100 ° C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>The process of roasting can be carried out in the roasting
drum or machine in a variety of ways, as:</p>

<p>1. Direct roasting over a coal fire,</p>

<p>2. Passing of a hot-air stream over the beans,</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13.</div>
</div>

<p>3. Roasting by means of gas, with compressed air, as far as
<em class="gesperrt">sources of heat</em> are concerned; and as regards <em class="gesperrt">shape of
the drum</em>, it is to be noted that the cylindrical are most in use.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
The separation of the shells from the kernel was still effected at the
beginning of the present century by stirring the beans in water and
so detaching the inner coating of the seeds, the method adopted by
Weisched (Mitscherlich page 112). Not till this stage had been
reached were they subjected to a strong heat, causing the shells to
spring off.</p>

<p>This method has at the present time only historical interest,
for the so-called roasting drums, as used in the preparation of coffee,
are now universal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13a.</div>
</div>

<p>Roasting must be attended with the greatest care, in order
that it may neither be too thorough nor insufficient. It is a great
mistake to think that the roasting machine can be handed over to the
care of any apprentice. That nicety of roasting which corresponds
to the variety and its subsequent utilisation constitutes the qualitative
basis of the chocolate manufactured later. It is impossible for
even the best chocolate maker to retrieve what has been spoilt
in this important preliminary operation, wherefore a skilled workman,
endowed with a keen sense of taste and smell, is always to be seen
at the roasting machine.</p>

<p>It has already been attempted to provide a means of security
against over-burning by the construction of the so-called safety-roaster,
about which will be spoken later.</p>

<p>Overroasting is immediately indicated by a disagreeable empyreumatic
odour (resembling that of roasted coffee); the husks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
char and the kernels crumble, also betraying a charring on the
outside. There is a correspondingly increasing keenness of flavour,
and a transference of theobromine from the kernel to the husks
(cf. page 65). From the destructive distillation of the cacao fat arises
that volatile and pungent acroleine which is the principal cause of
the empyreuma of the over-roasted bean.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p>The following general precautions in roasting cacao are worthy
of note; 1. the beans should not remain too long in the roasting drum;
2. they should be kept on the stir, for which reason the apparatus
is made revolvable on its axles; 3. the heat applied should be carefully
regulated; and 4. to guard against a loss of aroma, the roasted beans
should be cooled as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>As the cacao must be more or less roasted according to its
quality and ultimate destination, which entails the acquisition of considerable
empirical knowledge on the part of the workman entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
with this process, it would be neither advisable nor practicable to
annex definite instructions as to time and temperature requirements.</p>

<p>In the following we describe a machine which is to be found
in most factories and which corresponds to all the demands of
technique. From its heating system, it belongs to the class of hot-air
current roasters—direct coal fire assisting—and in shape to the
cylindrical roasters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14 a.</div>
</div>

<p>This machine is illustrated in fig. 14 and shown in section in
figs. 14 a and 14 b. To prevent loss of heat by radiation, to save fuel,
and preclude possibilities of danger from fire, the whole installation
is walled in. Driving shafts occur at the back of the machine, and the
charging apparatus is introduced in front. A furnace lies directly
under the drum, whilst on either side are chambers accessible to
currents of fresh air, which are provided with heating tubes and
which admit of a regulation of the air supply. They are shut off
from connection with the gases from the fire, so that only the fresh
air heated here can penetrate to the roasting products in the charged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
drum. There are winnowing shovels fitted in this, calculated to keep
the beans in motion and facilitate the access of air. When the hopper
is closed, the gases arising from the roast product can be led off by
an annexed outlet pipe, and thereupon condensed and the resulting
liquid drained off at the foot of the machine. For the attainment of the
proper degree of roasting, as well as for controlling the whole process,
there is a sampler to every machine. The drum is emptied whilst in
motion, its door-like front being turned aside and the roasted beans
transferred by the winnowing shovels before mentioned to trolleys
wheeled underneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14 b.</div>
</div>

<p>The loss of heat by radiation is very insignificant, as the
machine is completely walled in. Any kind of fuel may be used.
Since the stoking as well as the removal of soot takes place at the
front, several of these roasters can be set up side by side. It is a
great advantage of this installation, that by removal of the front of the
drum its interior is laid quite open, admitting of a thorough overhauling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which is attended with every disadvantage for the flavour of subsequent
roasting lots.</p>

<p>The machine here described is constructed in varying sizes,
with an outside capacity of four hundred kilograms.</p>

<p>As already mentioned the so-called safety-roaster offers a
certain security against the burning of the beans as the roasting boiler
is lifted out of the fire by means of an automatically working safety
regulator. Figs. 15 a and b show a spherical roaster open and closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15 a.</div>
</div>

<p>The principal of construction is founded on the fact that each
roasting is connected with a loss of weight and it is logical that the
same quality of beans always yields the same loss of weight at a
certain degree of roasting. On an average cacao yields a loss of
6-7 %. According to this, the loss of weight which can at first be
empirically ascertained, for example by a new kind of bean, can be
calculated and can be indicated on a regulator, on the principle of the
Roman scale. When the beans have lost the weight in question the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
counterpoise of the regulator raises the axle of the roasting sphere by
means of which the working of the whole machine is set in motion.</p>

<p>There is no exception to the rule that only beans of one and
the same kind should be roasted and broken up together, as thickness
or thinness of the shells determines to a large extent the time
required for roasting, and also an even size of bean is necessary to
the smooth operation of the breaking machine. The husks of the
roasted cacao bean are hygroscopic, and consequently the roasted
unshelled beans contain more moisture after having been kept for
a time, than they do in the raw state; but the drier the bean is,
the easier it shells. The cacao is therefore to be worked up as
quickly as possible, or at least kept in well covered metal boxes till
further treatment can be proceeded with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15 b.</div>
</div>

<p>As sources of heat we find direct and indirect stoking with
house coal and coal gas, and besides these, for the installations of
larger factories Dowson gas is especially suitable, as it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
involve too high a temperature, and the outlay is not so great as
when coal-gas is used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 16.</div>
</div>

<p>The roasting machine in fig. 16 for Dowson or coal gas belongs
to the class of roasters with direct firing. It corresponds to the
one diagrammed in Fig. 15 as regards charging and emptying. Here
also the front wall of the drum can be removed, and the interior
consequently laid completely open. The transmission of gas is
effected at an air pressure of one atmosphere, for the attainment of
which an air pump is fitted up in the vicinity, capable of feeding four
machines at the same time. The drum holds about 150 kilos.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
It goes without saying that the regulating of the requisite heat is in
this instance of the utmost ease and nicety. Another preponderating
advantage of this machine as compared with those heated with coke
or ordinary coal is its clean operation and the extraordinary speed
with which it can be both started and stopped. Form 3-4 cbm. of
coal gas are needed for 100 kilos of beans, whilst for Dowson gas,
which has not such a high heating value, much larger quantities are
required, and consequently a stronger framework becomes necessary,
though here no air pumps need be put in operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 17.</div>
</div>

<p>Steam roasting apparatus have not proved particularly successful,
as has been evident in all experiments hitherto made with them,
and steam agency does not appear to be suitable for the cacao bean,
it admitting of no thorough and at the same time even roasting.</p>

<p>Yet on the other hand the hot air-current roasters described
enjoy an ever increasing popularity, partly because they are heated
indirectly, and again because they appreciably diminish the time
taken up in the actual process, which in other cases approaches to as
much as thirty or forty minutes, without exposing the beans to the
danger of burning or getting charred.</p>

<p>As just stated, the beans should be passed on to the next
process as speedily as possible, yet on the other hand be completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
cooled off, so as to loosen their shells before they arrive in the
breaking machine. There are also special constructions for this cooling.
If the roasting drums are fitted up directly on the ground, it is effected
by disposing the beans issuing from these machines in wide baskets or
sieves, and letting them cool there before bringing them to the next
process. Should they be situated at a sufficient height, the beans
can be slowly transferred down a shoot connected with the rooms
below, where crushing mills await them, and cooled on the journey
by a play of fresh air currents.</p>

<p>Very much to the purpose and well adapted as regards most
of the requisite conditions, are the cooling trucks with exhaust apparatus
shown in fig. 17.</p>

<p>These trucks are fitted with perforated false bottoms and with
sliding shutters at the side. After the contents of the roasting machine
have been discharged into the trucks, these are wheeled over to
the exhaust apparatus easily recognisable in the diagram, where
the cacao is so far cooled that subsequent “after-roasting” is impossible,
whilst the gases given off are conducted by the ventilator.
This exhaust chamber can be made to work from both sides.</p>


<h5>3. <em class="gesperrt">Crushing, hulling and cleansing.</em></h5>

<p>Up to ten years ago, the crushing and shelling of cacao beans
had not been so far perfected as to effect the complete separation
of husk and radicle from all particles of kernel, or to prevent loss
by isolating and collecting the minute particles of kernel, which are
drawn up through the exhaust apparatus in conjunction with the
lightest of the cacao shells. Yet the requirements demanded of a
satisfactory machine advanced to such an extent that not only cacao
nibs free from shell were postulated—an end scarcely hard to attain—but
shells free from cacao nibs were made a further essential. A
machine which performs both these objects not only works excellently,
but is also economical. For a solution of this problem the
Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers, which is specially
interested in all that concerns the chocolate industry, offered a prize
years ago; the firm of J. M. Lehmann were the first to construct a
machine answering every call made on it to perfection.</p>

<p>Fig. 18 illustrates a crushing and cleansing machine averaging
an output of 2500-3000 kilos, of the latest and most modern type.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 18.</div>
</div>

<p>The beans are first broken into smaller pieces in all
machines now employed as crushing, shelling or cleansing apparatus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and the one at present under consideration provides no exception.
An air-current is made to play on these fragments, which finally
isolates and transfers the loosened shells to another part of the
apparatus. The cacao next succeeds to a crusher of regular capacity
lodged in the upper part of the machine, being despatched on an
elevator. The fragments fall into a cylindrical sieve, dust being
detached in the first compartment, whilst the meshes of subsequent
compartments gradually increase in size and sort the products therein
transmitted in corresponding sizes. There is a groove traversed by
air-currents—proceeding from a ventilator—immediately under each
compartment. This current of air can be regulated, i. e. made weaker
for lighter and stronger for heavier fragments, and there is a ventilator
for every compartment to make this regulation of the easiest,
and in this way shells of equal size but specifically lighter than,
the cacao fragments are most efficaciously separated. Contrasting
with the older type of machine, it works almost noiselessly, all
shakings of grooves and sieves being entirely avoided; in addition
to which there is a perfect exclusion of dust, when the shells are
transferred into the dust-removing chamber. A further advantage is
that there is no wearing out of the machine, except as regards the
direct crushing apparatus, which occasionally need renewing.</p>

<p>The dust particles before mentioned, which possibly comprise
as much as one half of the cacao fragments, require a special kind
of working up, on <em class="gesperrt">different machines</em>, before the cacao still
contained therein can be obtained. It is a fact obvious and apparent,
that the smaller the fragments of shell mixed with this crushed cacao,
the more difficult will be their separation, a fact of equal importance
to technical and analytical science, and the more scrupulously this
process is to be carried out, the greater the lavishment on sieves
and ventilating compartments entailed.</p>

<p>To effect this operation on the breaking machine is seriously
to overtask the latter, and defeats its own end, as experiments carried
out in the Chocolate factory of Schütte-Felsche have proved,
inasmuch as it leads very easily to mixing of the products which are
to be kept separate.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 shows such a machine for the cleansing of this so-called
cacao “dust</p>

<p>The particles are raised to a large flat sieve by means of

currents of corresponding strength. The quantity obtained varies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
according to the variety of cacao, though in some cases it may
amount to 50 or 54 percent. What remains after this process is absolutely
worthless and can only be considered as refuse, at least as
far as the chocolate manufacturer is concerned.</p>

<p>It has become necessary in modern manufacture that iron
fragments occurring in the machine not only be separated by
distinct magnetic fields in the respective machines, but that this also
be effected in a machine specially constructed for the purpose.
Fig. 20 illustrates such an electromagnetic apparatus. The advantages
of this system are that it avoids magnets limited in strength,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and by the functioning of strong electro-magnets perfect cleansing
even in the case of the largest output, as well as machines of
the most simple construction, can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>We submit the following description of the machine and its
method of working.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 20.</div>
</div>

<p>The machine contains a hopper with sloping groove to obtain
an even introduction of the beans to be cleansed. At the end of this
there is an electro-magnet roller, consisting of a non-magnetised
mantle and a magnetic compartment round which it turns.</p>

<p>After traversing the sloping groove, the beans succeed to
the roller, meeting it at a tangent. As soon as they reach the field
of magnetism, all iron fragments are appropriated by the revolving
mantle, whilst the beans themselves do not come into contact with
this, but pass directly underneath. The iron fragments are disposed
of separately, and outside the magnetising area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>It is of prime importance in the preparation of chocolate and
more particularly of cocoa powder (easily soluble cacao), that the
crushed material proceeding from the crushing machine should
undergo a further purification, with a view to separating, and removing
the hard radicles. These constitute the gritty sediment of
insufficiently prepared cacao powder, when dissolved. J. M. Lehmann
effects the complete removal of the radicle by means of his machine
D. R. G. M. No. 24,989 (Fig. 21).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21.</div>
</div>

<p>Here the finer siftings from the crusher are transferred to the
controlling feeder, under which a small ventilator occurs, which
provides for the removal of any still remaining portions of husk.
Cacao and radicle descend to a shaking sieve, the finer particles
passing through its meshes, whilst the larger grains fall into a pocket
attached to the end, as cleansed product. The former fragments
now succeed to a cylinder, having its inner surface punched with
small cavities (fig. 22) and while the cacao particles remain in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
cavities during the rotation of the cylinder, the radicles of more
elongated form are caught up by a special separator (1) and so prevented
from being carried round with the rest. The cacao particles
are then made to fall into a trough (3) by a brush (2) working
against the cylinder, and subsequently urged forward by a conveyor
(4). That process is enacted all along the cylinder, so that finally
cacao and radicle issue from the machine completely separated.</p>

<p>The advantages, economical and otherwise, attending the use of
the above breaking and cleansing machines become apparent when
the following figures, registering results obtained in several experiments,
are considered. Formerly the loss experienced in sorting,
roasting, crushing and hulling averaged about 30 % of the total beans,
but now the employment of the above machines shows the following
satisfactory improvements.</p>

<p>The loss of 823 kg Machala beans, unroasted, amounted to
a total:</p>

a saving of about 10 percent more material than in former work.</p>

<p>In connection with these particulars it is also of interest to

<p>From these data it is evident that there is a great difference
between the chemical composition of the so called cacao waste
and that of the exterior ligneous shells. From the large amount of
fat present in the former material it might be regarded, in the full
sense of the term, as a cacao constituent and, for that reason, its
presence in cacao preparations should not be objected to, while the
husk containing as much as 20 percent of woody fibre cannot be
considered a cacao constituent in the same sense.</p>


<h5>4. <em class="gesperrt">Mixing different kinds.</em></h5>

<p>Stress has already been laid on the variations in taste incidental
to different species of bean. It has further to be noted that they
develop a milder and more aromatic flavour according as they have
been more properly fermented, and in contrary instances possess an
astringent and even acid taste. It therefore becomes an aim of the
manufacturer so to improve the flavour of inferior varieties by
mixing with the finer as to produce a resultant cacao giving perfect
satisfaction to every taste. Nevertheless the general rule still holds
good that for the preparation of the finest qualities of chocolate only
the better sorts of bean (as Caracas, Ariba, Puerto Cabello etc.) should
be employed. For inferior and less expensive ware other varieties
of bean suffice, the mixture being obviously regulated by the prevailing
market prices.</p>

<p>In many instances the proportions of such mixtures are kept
secret by the manufacturer as matters of importance, and every
individual manufacturer has his own method and specialities as
regards such blends.</p>

<p>Ceylon cacaos are not used so much as mixing varieties, but
almost exclusively as covering agents, to make other cacaos lighter
coloured (sometimes almost approaching yellow).</p>

<p>The beans are weighed off in these proportions on a sensitive
scale, and then passed on to be ground and triturated into cacao
paste.</p>


<h4>II. Production of the Cacao Mass.</h4>


<h5>5. <em class="gesperrt">Fine grinding and trituration.</em></h5>

<p>Formerly the roasted, crushed, and decorticated beans were
frequently ground before being transferred to the “Melangeur”,—a
machine that will be described later—, in which they were then
reduced to a finer state of sub-division and lastly mixed with sugar.
For this grinding, mills of various construction were employed (as
Weldon, Pintus etc.). But as time rolled on the Melangeur took the
place of these preliminary grinding mills, and in this it was
endeavoured to effect that fine division of the cacao mass which is
essential to the production of a homogeneous cacao and sugar intermixture,
but without complete success. Cylinder rolling machines
(French method) were the first to attain this result.</p>

<p>At the present time, the roasted and cleansed kernels are
ground so fine as to become a semi-liquid when subjected to heat, and
that is done whatever the ultimate destiny of the cacao, whether it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
be intended for chocolate or cocoa powder. This object is obtained
by means of special mills, constructed with “Over-runners</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 23.</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 24 a.</div>
</div>

<p>These cacao mills, which were formerly but seldom met with in
chocolate factories, have now become indispensable necessaries, since
they have the advantage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>1. of rendering the cacao mass in this semi-glucose form more
easily miscible with sugar, a factor of the highest importance for the
commoner and cheaper qualities of chocolate;</p>

<p>2. of grinding the cacao as fine as possible in one operation
and the simplest manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 24 b.</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 24 c.</div>
</div>

<p>But side by side with the appreciation which these mills met
with, there arose a corresponding increase in the demands made on
them, such as the utmost nicety, greatest possible output, and least
possible necessity of after-heating, and these have been successively
answered by twin, triple and at the present time even quadruple
mills. fig. 23 shows a simple grinding mill which can only come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
consideration in connection with the smallest of branches, whilst
Fig. 24 a and b illustrates another with three successive stones arranged
one above the other, such as will be found in all the larger factories
of to-day. Also a triple mill but with grindstones of increasing
size pictured in fig. 24 c. A mill possessing four pairs of grinding
stones is given in fig. 25, and is calculated to meet each and every
conceivable demand.</p>

<p>Whilst simple, double and triple mills are brought on the
market in different sizes, corresponding to the outputs required, these
quadruple mills are only constructed in the largest sizes. They grind
perfectly, and without detriment to the flavour, deliver quantities
of cacao figuring at from 1000 to 1200 kilos daily. There is naturally
a larger output if the fatty contents of the cacao are considerable, a
thorough roasting being always presupposed.</p>

<p>The axles occurring on these quadruple grinding mills are
connected with one another by means of spur-wheels, and the axles
themselves run in ball-bearings, which not only permits a perfectly
noiseless operation of the machine, but also makes the action very
easy, that is to say, dependent on only very little motor power.
The cacao is raised to the hopper by means of an elevator, where the
quantity introduced into the machine is regulated, and then passes
between crushers occurring in the middle of the first pair of grinding
stones, which it subsequently leaves as a pasty mass. It is then
conducted along a groove into the second mill, and here undergoes
further grinding, and so to the third and fourth, where the process
can be described as trituration, for the cacao leaves the machine
in liquid form. Only in this manner is it possible to obtain the finest
ground product, without any disastrous accompaniment of excessive
heating.</p>

<p>Cacao mills with one stone suffice for the production of chocolate
mass on a small scale, but for the manufacture of cocoa powder,
twin or triple grinders must be employed.</p>

<p>All these are of the “Over-runner” type, act by their own
weight, and consequently do not involve the disastrous consequences
which were entailed by the “Under-runners” tried formerly.</p>

<p>About the middle of the nineties of the last century, experiments
were made with a view to superseding these types with mills having
stones of varying sizes, and first larger upper stones of a grinding
pair were tried, then larger under stones, but neither have been able
to maintain themselves in the workshop, and the grinders of equal
size still hold good as the fittest and most popular.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Attempts have recently been made to introduce a machine
combining mill and roller. Its value lies in the fact that with a relative
increase in the grinding rapidity, it does not involve a greater than
requisite heat, and on emerging from the machine the cacao shows
no deficiencies as to flavour, and is withal much finer than that
produced in other processes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 26.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 26 shows such a machine. The mill on this serves merely to
reduce the hard kernel to a pulp, and this admits of the grinding
stones being placed farther apart, and so occasions no heat. Trituration
is then effected by a roller apparatus, for which operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
machines with four rollers have been proved most satisfactory. As
such roller machines are furnished with water-cooling systems, it
is possible for the cacao to be kept cool even on these.</p>


<h5>6. <em class="gesperrt">Mixture with sugar and spices.</em></h5>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.</div>
</div>

<p>A thorough mixing with sugar can only be effected when the
cacao paste is heated to a temperature rather above the melting
point of cacao butter, that is to say, as high as from 35° to 40° C.,
and consequently the incorporating machine in which that operation
is carried on is provided with a steam jacket. For this process it is
advisable to have the chocolate in a semi-liquid condition, wherefore
the ground cacao issuing from the mills is transferred to steam-heated
vessels (fig. 27) fitted with taps suitable for drawing off the
mass as it is required. Formerly the cacao mass was fed into the
melangeur in lumps and there liquefied. But as this necessitated the
application of heat to the melangeur, attended with the risk of
cracking its under-plating, and also a postponement of the mixing
processes, whereby considerable time was lost, this method no
longer obtains to-day. It is at present usual not only to warm the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
cacao mass beforehand, but the sugar also, by storing it in warm
chambers, so that the whole paste possesses a uniform temperature,
lowering of temperature in the melangeur is avoided, and there is
consequently no waste of the heating steam.</p>

<p>In some large factories the actual incorporation of cacao and
sugar is preceded by a preliminary mixing of large quantities, which
considerably relieves the strain on the melangeur, whilst it keeps the
machine rooms as far as possible free from superfluous dust.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>
</div>

<p>The mixing machine shown in fig. 28 can here be used with
advantage. As will be seen on comparing the illustration, it is provided
with a shifting trough. Such a machine, when closed down,
is capable of mixing from 100-500 kilos of chocolate. The mixing
is effected by means of two suitably shaped blades, and the heating
by a steam jacket. After the operation is completed, the mixed
material is turned out into portable troughs, and after having been
kept in a warm chamber for some length of time, transferred to the
melangeur for further treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>It has been found advantageous to keep the chocolate mass
so obtained in suitable receptacles for several days<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>, at a temperature
of not less than 20° C. and between that figure and 40° C.
So the sugar is enabled to penetrate the entire mass, which now
proceeds to the rolling processes carried out in the melangeur and
rolling machines. Shortly before its discharge from the latter, it
is mixed with spices, vanillin, eatherial oils and so forth.</p>

<h5>7. <em class="gesperrt">Treatment of the Mixture.</em></h5>


<h6>a) Trituration.</h6>

<p>In describing the mixing machines, we do not intend to enter
into details regarding the machines formerly in use, but merely to
give a brief outline of the principles illustrated in their construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Trituration was formerly produced;</p>

<p>
1. by rollers running backwards and forwards on a grinder;<br />
2. by several cones rotating in a circle on a disc-shaped bed;<br />
3. by means of rotating stones running in a trough;<br />
4. by means of several cylindrical rollers;<br />
5. by means of grooved cone moving in a grooved casing.<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a><br />
</p>

<p>At the present time only the type mentioned under 1. and 4.
are in general use. 3. is met with less frequently, and will be
described at greater length in a subsequent paragraph.</p>

<p>The machines 1. and 3. are put into operation prior to the
cylinder rolling mills, which finish off the incorporation of chocolate
and sugar and the levigation process only begun in the first-named.</p>

<p>The machines constructed in the manner described under 3.,
to which we now turn, were introduced by G. Hermann of Paris,
but are at present almost obsolete. Since they have some historical
interest and are typical of the development of the melangeur, we
annex a rough sketch showing their general construction in fig. 29.</p>

<p>The ellipsoid runners <i>a</i> made of granite work in the trough <i>i</i>
which is also of granite and is fitted with the casing <i>h</i>. The runners
rotate on their axles <i>b</i> so as to move in a circle. The two arms of
the axis <i>b</i> have at the centre an elliptical ring with a quadrangular
opening, into which fits the similar shaped part of the vertical shaft <i>c</i>
fitted with the toothed wheels, <i>d</i> and <i>d′</i>, which are set in motion by
power transmitted to the shaft and its connections. The arm <i>b</i> has
some play downwards, so that it can adjust itself vertically according
to the greater or less quantity of material in the mill. The two
steel blades, <i>e</i> and <i>e′</i>, are shaped to fit the cavity of the trough; being
connected with the shaft <i>c</i> they revolve with it and sweep down
the cacao mass adhering to the sides of the mill. Between the
foundation <i>k</i> and the trough <i>i</i> there is a space <i>l</i> into which steam
can be introduced through <i>f</i>, the condensed water passing away by <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>All machines of this kind have now been displaced by the
melangeur which is capable of turning out a much larger quantity
of material with a relatively smaller expenditure of power. The
operation of mixing chocolate is not a mere mixing, for the
<em class="gesperrt">pressure</em> exerted by the <em class="gesperrt">runners</em> is also an indispensable factor.
On that account the ordinary mixing machines have not proved
serviceable, especially in the case of chocolates containing a small
amount of fat, such as the cheaper kinds, while the addition of cacao<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
butter to facilitate the working of the machine would considerably
increase the cost of production. Melangeurs are generally constructed
on the same principle as the edge runner grinding mills
which are so much used; but they differ from them in so far as the
bed-stone revolves, while the runners merely rotate on their axles
without revolving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.</div>
</div>

<p>The melangeur with travelling bed-stone, as constructed by
Lehmann, is shown at fig. 30; it is fitted with an arrangement for
lifting out the runners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 31.</div>
</div>

<p>The bed-stone as well as the runners are made of granite.
Each runner has an axis working in plummer blocks, so that it can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
lifted out independently of the other one. By that construction the
runners are prevented from taking an oblique position as was the
case with the mills formerly made, since one runner would be
forced downwards or tilted on its outer edge whenever the other
one was raised up somewhat. The bed-stone of this machine revolves
and it is easily heated by steam pipes from below. One important
advantage of this machine is that being low it can be very easily
charged and emptied. The contrivance for lifting out the runners
prevents them thumping upon the bed-stone that might otherwise
readily happen when starting the machine, and it also lessens the
wear of the driving bands; moreover, large lumps of sugar or cacao
are very readily crushed down and, so, the working is much facilitated.
The emptying of the melangeur is readily and safely effected,
while the bed stone is revolving, by holding a shovel so that the
cacao is thrown up against the shovel. A melangeur of this construction
is represented by fig. 31; it has three runners and underneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the bed-stone is fitted a steam engine which supplies driving power,
the exhaust steam being used for heating the machine.</p>

<p>Although this emptying by hand is not attended with any
serious drawbacks, yet it involves loss of time and is rather inconvenient,
so that the demand for mechanical automatism in this
operation was very considerable. It is now some years since Messrs.
J. M. Lehmann patented an apparatus for the mechanical discharging
of the chocolate mass from these machines, but their invention still
holds good. A melangeur provided with such apparatus is shown
on fig. 31. Here a vertically moving shovel is sunk behind the
outlet, gradually damming the material, and causing it to rise above
the edge of the tank and fall through the opening. A second but
horizontally working arrangement, which in this case as in the last
is controllable by means of a crank, conducts the remainder of the
material to the same shovel. So the material is discharged within a
few minutes.—These melangeurs are built for varying outputs.
Fig. 32 illustrates one of the largest yet constructed. Its base has a
diameter of 2 metres, and the machine itself has a capacity of 5 cwts.
To avoid the mixing of dust with the sugar as far as possible, the
whole melangeur is provided with a dust-proof protector.</p>


<h6>b) Levigation.</h6>

<p>An extreme fineness and homogeneity of the chocolate mass
is obtained in the employment of cylindrical rolling machines, for
the construction of which we are indebted to G. Hermann of Paris.
Every kind of chocolate must be passed through the rolling machine
at least once or twice even when finely powdered sugar is used,
though in this case it is less a question of sub-division than of incorporation
and intermixture. The best qualities are passed through the
machine from six to eight times, or even more. The mass is finally
fed into the machine in cold blocks and so ground off. Granite is
the material chiefly employed in making the rollers, although it is
not every variety which can be adapted to this purpose. Apart
from the fact that granite, or indeed any other mineral stone, seldom
occurs in compact masses and free from flaws, neither porphyry
nor the stone generally described as granite is suitable for employment
in the construction of mill rollers. A kind is generally preferred
which intermediates between granite and porphyry as to hardness
and possesses excellent grinding capacities, and which goes by the
name of diorite. No other stone can compare with this diorite in
respect to the above qualities, and the chief firms engaged in the
construction of roller machines possess their own quarries. But we
shall return to this later, for recently experiments with case-hardened
casting rollers (Krupp steel) and hard porcelain have yielded very
flattering results.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<img src="images/i_125b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 33 b.</div>
</div>

<p>We shall now enter into more detail respecting the principle
illustrated by these rolling machines. The plasticity of the chocolate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
mass necessitates a rotation of the cylinder surfaces in opposite directions
with dissimilar velocities. Accordingly two or more rollers are
caused to work against each other, and in compliance with this principle
of sub-division with differential velocities, their axles are fitted
with wheels, of which each has a different number of cogs.</p>

<p>So those rollers furnished with the greater number of teeth
revolve more slowly, whilst in opposite instances there is a corresponding
acceleration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 34.</div>
</div>

<p>The construction of the machines now in use differs more or
less from that of the type first invented by Hermann, plan and elevation
of which appear in figs. 33 a and 33 b respectively.<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>The granite rollers at <i>a<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> are fitted with an octagonal
iron axle that is somewhat thicker at the interior part and they are
mounted upon a frame as shown in the drawing. The sockets of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
central rollers <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> are fixed and each one is held in position by three sets
screws; those of the two other rollers can be shifted along grooves
in the frame and when the cylinders <i>a<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> have been brought
into proper position relatively to the cylinder <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> they are held fast
by the set screws <i>p</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 36.</div>
</div>

<p>For the purpose of this adjustment, there is at each end of
the machine a horizontal wrought iron shaft <i>f</i> that can be turned
by the winch <i>e</i>, and these shafts are fitted with two endless screws <i>d</i>
working in the corresponding wheels <i>c</i>. These occur on the spindles
<i>a</i>, which screw in and out of the bearing blocks of the rollers <i>a<sup>1</sup></i>
and <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>, but turn only in the fixed collars <i>b</i> without being shifted
from their place. The result is that on turning the cranks <i>e</i> the
corresponding cylinder <i>a<sup>1</sup></i> or <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> is moved nearer to, or further from,
the central cylinder <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>, while the position of all of them always
remains parallel. The shaft <i>Q</i> is set in motion by the driving wheel
<i>L</i> fitted with the loose wheel <i>L<sup>1</sup></i>. It acts first upon the cog wheel <i>K</i>
which works in the larger wheel <i>J</i> on the axle of the central roller <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>That works in the cog wheel <i>O</i> and the wheel <i>P</i> fitted to the roller <i>a<sup>1</sup></i>
driving them as well as the wheel <i>M</i> and the pinion <i>N</i> of the roller <i>a<sup>3</sup></i>
The result is that the axle <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> makes 1&frac34; revolutions and <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> 6-1/8 revolutions
while <i>a<sup>1</sup></i> in the same time makes only one revolution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 37.</div>
</div>

<p>The cacao or chocolate is supplied to this machine by the
hopper <i>R</i> which is placed between the rollers <i>a<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>. The pasty
mass adhering to the rollers is carried forward by the quicker moving
roller <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> and it is ground finer between the rollers <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>a<sup>3</sup></i>, after
which the material is removed from <i>a<sup>3</sup></i> at the outer side by an
adjustable blade <i>gg</i> and then falls down into a receptacle below.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Figs. 38 and 39.</div>
</div>

<p>On the design fig. <a href="#Page_126">34</a>34 we see a machine of more modern construction
ready mounted. The receptacle parts of the same are arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and connected in full agreement with the above mentioned except
that the motion is effected by the driving power fitted to the machine
on the ground on the left side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 40.</div>
</div>

<p>The principle of this roller machine has long been applied in
the building of other types, and we find that these, variously altered,
renovated and improved, are to-day an indispensable equipment in
every chocolate factory. In the following pages we give a
description of some of the best-known constructions of refiner.</p>

<p>The so called battery rolling mills constitute a remarkable
innovation. It is apparent that the more rollers a cylinder machine
contains, and the greater their length and diameter, all the more
efficacious will the working of the machine be. Batteries have
accordingly been constructed, whereby two, three or more roller
systems are combined, one to every three rollers, and rising one
above the other, so that they slant upwards much as shown in Fig. 40.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>As the battery rolling mills possessed the disadvantages that
they took up too much room and could not be well fed and regulated,
they are generally replaced by rolling machines of from 6 to 9 rollers,
first constructed by J. M. Lehmann. These rolling machines of 6 to
9 rollers which we see before us in Figs. <a href="#Page_127">35</a>35 and <a href="#Page_128">36</a>36 are really systems
of 3 rollers fitted one over the other. They therefore take up the
room of a 3-roller machine and are quite as easy to work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41 a.</div>
</div>

<p>As will be seen from the design of a nine-roller apparatus,
fig. 37, the chocolate mass descends from one roller system to the
other, and is fine rolled in a third of the time otherwise required,
and at one operation, with corresponding saving of labour. The nine
roller apparatus are provided with landing stage and steps, and fed
either by means of elevators, or from above.</p>

<p>Fig. 38 shows a recent construction, three roller apparatus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
(case castings, cf. below) standing vertically, which accordingly takes
up little room. The hopper is low-lying, whilst the discharging is
effected from the upper roller, and accordingly admits of the
occasional use of a somewhat larger size of transport trolley. This
type also occurs with 6-9-12 rollers, as apparent from fig. 39.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41 b.</div>
</div>

<p>Whilst these systems were exclusively supplied with rollers
made of granite or hard porcelain up to a few years ago, it has been
found that good results are obtained by the use of cast rollers, and
they have been for some time employed on machines of three, four
and five rollers. (Figs. 38, 40, 41 a-c.) In consequence of the non-porous
surface of these steel rollers, it is possible to grind to a finest powder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
merely in one operation, without passing the chocolate through the machine
several times; and the so-called “Burning” of masses which have
not been properly mixed cannot arise in this case, though it is true
that the apparatus must be provided with water cooling arrangements
to avoid a too excessive heat. They are specially adapted to the preparation
of the more ordinary qualities, and are even occasionally
employed for finer chocolates, for obviously these must be again
submitted to a rolling process, when granite or porcelain rollers are
preferred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41 c.</div>
</div>

<p>For this reason the 6, 9 or even 12 roller mills have been more
discarded since the last grinding process has been performed by granite
rollers (cold process).</p>

<p>In order to avoid the disadvantages of the pulley drive, it is
in certain cases advisable to drive each machine direct from an
electric motor. Fig. 42 illustrates a refining machine driven in this
manner.</p>

<h6>c) <em class="gesperrt">Proportions for mixing cacao mass, sugar and
spices.</em></h6>

<p>The relative proportions of cacao, sugar, and spices, as well
as of starch as in the manufacture of the cheaper sorts, vary considerably.
Generally speaking 50 or 60 parts of sugar are added for
50 or 40 parts of cacao mass; the following are a few formulae
applicable for the production of those kinds of pure chocolate that
are most used.</p>

<p>The powdered spices as given above may be replaced by
corresponding essential oils, but see page <a href="#Page_237">237</a> for remarks on
this point.</p>

<p>If the chocolates made from beans rich in oil contain too much
fat to mould properly, a small percentage of their constituent cacao
mass can be replaced by cocoa powder made from the same kind
of bean, but defatted, in the case of the finer qualities; and when
inferior varieties are under consideration, the same result may be
attained by a sufficient increase in the proportion of their other constituent,
sugar, as e. g. 55-60 parts of to 45 or 40 parts of cacao mass,
so disturbing the usual equality of the two ingredients mixed together.
Very cheap chocolates in particular are prepared from a smaller
percentage of cacao mass and show a corresponding increase in their
sugar content. But if the sugar exceeds 65 percent, it is no longer
possible to mould these chocolates, and the addition of fresh cacao
butter becomes a necessary preliminary to this operation, cf. also
the first part in section IV. Such varieties would have a composition
somewhat like the following:</p>

<p>In the experimental preparation of samples of chocolate mass it is
not advisable to employ large quantities of ingredients, when a waste
of material is bound to ensue, but to begin with mixing small quantities
of one or two kilos. The small Universal Kneading and Mixing
Machines, Patent Werner &amp; Pfleiderer, Type 1, Class BS, can here
be used with advantage. They are specially intended for small
outputs and experimental work; but we shall return to their description
later, after stating that they are furnished with heating
apparatus, stuffing boxes and air-tight lid, and can easily be taken to
pieces, greatly facilitating the removing of the mass.</p>

<p>Recently the creams sometimes described as in the heading
have enjoyed a vast popularity, and are sold as eatable chocolates in
ever-increasing quantities. As far as can be ascertained, they were
first manufactured in Switzerland, melt readily, and have a correspondingly
large amount of fat, resulting from the addition of cacao butter,
which distinguishes them from ordinary chocolates. When readily
melting chocolates were first introduced, it was a prevailing opinion
that the required property could only be obtained by increasing the
amount of fatty content. Now the excessive evidence of fat in
chocolates is very objectionable, both as regards taste and digestibility.
To avoid this, therefore, the chocolates are treated mechanically,
to attain the required character of readily melting. The machines
used for that purpose are termed “Conches”, because the trough, in
which the chocolate is rubbed into a long cylinder, has somewhat the
shape of a long shell. For the working up of chocolates in conches,
the necessary conditions are;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">1. that the chocolate should have been ground perfectly fine,</p>

<p class="hang">2. it must contain such an amount of fat as to become glucose
on warming, not indeed so thin as that used as coating
material, but nevertheless softer than the ordinary cake-chocolate
of good quality.</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption">Fig. 44.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>The machine can be heated by means of steam, hot water
pipes, gas or charcoal stoking, according as they are available in
the place of installation, and the temperature should rise above
70-80° C. for fondants, and 50° C. for milk chocolates. In factories
with water power or electricity, continuous fondant machines can
be worked day and night, but when only worked during the day,
must be kept warm overnight. Constant tending of the machine is
unnecessary, as it works automatically. After a treatment of from
40-48 hours, the chocolate attains the requisite character (i.e. it melts
readily), and a rounding off of taste, which are the properties of all
good brands. Milk chocolates can also be advantageously prepared
in the conche, as also covering or coating cacaos of all kinds, which
harden considerably in consequence of this treatment.</p>

<p>Figs. 43 and 43 a show quadruple conches of the modern
type with hot water, wherein four troughs are arranged in pairs,
and one opposite the other. Conches with only 1 and 2 troughs
are also constructed, and in various sizes, the troughs sometimes
having a capacity of 125 and 200 kilos, so that the quadruple
conche is capable of holding five or eight hundred kilograms
in all. The curved bottom of the troughs, as well as the rollers
fitted in them, are made of granite, and the front wall
strongly bent in at the corner, so that the mass is forced over
the border of the front wall, where there are openings for its
discharge as well. To prevent radiation as far as possible, it is
best that the troughs be walled in, the troughs are either walled.
Fig. 44 shows the room of a modern chocolate factory, with
15 conches.</p>

<p>“Chocolats fondants” are from a gastronomic point of view,
the finest chocolate product on the market, and it is not remarkable
that this branch of the chocolate manufacture has witnessed a considerable
extension, and is likely to extend still more.</p>


<h5>9. <em class="gesperrt">Heating chambers and closets.</em></h5>

<p>The manufacture of chocolate has been very considerably
facilitated by the introduction of heating chambers and closets, which
have now become an indispensable feature of every factory in the
industry. In these chambers the chocolate which has still to be
rolled, as well as that already submitted to this operation, is stored
and kept at a temperature of 60° C. until it can be further treated
(moulded). This manner of heating involves an appreciable cheapening
of the production, for masses which are dry and apparently require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
an addition of fat recover in such a manner during a twenty
four hours’ storing in the heating chambers that such addition becomes
unnecessary. But especially when chill casting rollers are employed,
which the mass leaves in a very dry state, the use of these heating
chambers is indispensable. They should be available in every factory
to such an extent as to find room for the total output of one day,
though even twice or three times this amount might very well be
provided for. Closets heated by steam are best adapted for small
factories, such as are illustrated in Fig. 45. They possess double
doors, are walled in, and are capable of holding from 300-400 kilos
of chocolate mass for each metre of length. Larger factories should
furnish themselves with chambers, which are more open to access and
on the walls of which iron shelves can be introduced, heated by
steam pipes arranged underneath. A typical chamber, measuring 2·8
metres in breadth (including passage) and 5 metres in length would
hold about 2,500 kg of chocolate.</p>

<h5>10. <em class="gesperrt">Removal of Air and Division.</em></h5>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 46.</div>
</div>

<p>After emerging from the final rolling process, the chocolate is
stored up in heating chambers until it is ready to succeed to the
moulding, prior to which, however, it must be freed from air and cut
up into small portions. Until recently, it usually came next in a
melangeur provided with a dish-shaped bed-stone made of granite,
as illustrated in fig. 46, where it was kneaded and reduced to a uniform
plasticity and heated to the temperature required for moulding.
The melangeurs devoted to this purpose are now superseded by special
tempering machines.</p>

<p>A machine of this recent construction, used for working solid
and semi-liquid material, is shown in fig. 47. The tank intended as
a receptacle for the chocolate mass is in this case made of iron
and, to facilitate cleaning, smooth in the interior. It runs in a
water-bath, the supply in which can be controlled by steam or cold
water. The granite runner is provided with a lifting device, ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>mitting
of the working up of material containing foreign ingredients
like nuts, whole and fine-split.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 47.</div>
</div>

<p>The mass is taken out of the machine in lumps, and in order that
it may be reduced to a temperature suitable for the removal of air
(about 26-32 ° C. on the outside) it is laid to cool on wooden, marble
or iron tables. When this temperature is arrived at, large lumps of
chocolate are introduced either into the air-extracting or the dividing
machines.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 48.</div>
</div>

<p>After the importance of the tempering processes had at length
been recognised, inasmuch as the maintenance of the temperature
prescribed is of immense influence on the chocolate subsequently
produced, and it had on the other hand been ascertained that such
machines as described above could not be absolutely relied upon,
for the shaking tables involve an occasional excess of tempering,
the idea of a machine which should completely and automatically
perform this task was finally conceived. This new machine, given
in fig. 48, and already differing from all other tempering machines
in external appearance, ushers in an entirely fresh process respecting
the <i>modus operandi</i> prevailing in the present manufacture of
chocolate, which does not fail to satisfy the highest expectations.
It may be said to work continuously, for no matter what the temperature
of chocolate passing into it may be, the material leaves the
machine at the temperature desired within a lapse of one minute.
According as more or less chocolate has to be turned over in the
moulding department, the machine can be stopped or set in motion
without detriment to its efficacy. Besides this, it cleans almost automatically,
so that a quick change of quality is always possible. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
special virtue of this machine is that it turns out the material with
such a degree of homogeneity as has never before been known,
making moulding at much higher temperatures a possibility. There
is yet another side issue, namely a doubling of the life of the moulds,
and finally, owing to the fact that the often considerable amount of
waste material is done away with in this process, the moulding shop
is spared to some extent. The series of rollers through which the
chocolate passes is maintained at a proper temperature by means
of automatic water apparatus. The daily output of the machine figures
at 3000-4000 kilograms. The material is passed on out of this
machine to the dividing and moulding processes.</p>

<p>The necessary extraction of air follows immediately on
the tempering process, for the blades of the scraper then release the
chocolate mass from the rollers in thin layers, between which air
penetrates. The removal of air is effected by machines, an old type
of which is shown in fig. 49 (in front elevation).</p>

<p>It can be warmed by means of a charcoal fire placed in the
space <b>i</b>, or by any other suitable means. The chocolate mass is
fed into the cylindrical hopper <b>a</b>, at the base of which occurs an
archimedian screw <b>b</b>, which is propelled by the shaft and cog-wheel
system <b>c d e</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow. Thus the chocolate
mass is forced into the box <b>f</b>, leaving which in cylindrical form,
it succeeds to the travelling band <b>h</b>. It is now almost entirely freed
from air. As the material is pushed forward on the band, it is cut
off either by a knife <b>g</b> fixed to the box <b>f</b>, or divided as far as possible
into equal parts by a double knife with adjustable blades corresponding
to the weight required for a chocolate square. This manipulation
presupposes a fair amount of skill on the part of the machinist, but
this once attained, the division ensues as precisely and simply as
can be desired.</p>

<p>Air-extracting machines of recent construction, although still
partially built on the above principle, are at the same time generally
developed as automatic dividing machines.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 50.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 50 shows such a machine for solid and semi-liquid chocolates.
By means of this, the material is next conducted along a vertical
screw path in even mass to the horizontal screw, and so a second
filling with the hand is rendered unnecessary. After it has been freed
from air in this, it enters a revolverlike cutter, which discharges the
divided portions on a travelling belt. On the latter it is conducted to
a table standing near, where it is laid into moulds. The machine is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of very strong make, and puts out from 15-250 gr, divided into
approximately 10-25000 squares, within a space of ten hours.</p>

<p>Figs. 51 a and b give finally two of the best known types
which have a very extensive application, protected by patent imperial
(Germany), and built by J. M. Lehmann, Herm. Baumeister,
J. S. Petzholdt in Döhlen, G, near Dresden and others. With this
patent dividing machine of J. M. Lehmann, solid and semi-liquid
chocolate material, as also nut and almond chocolates are divided
exactly, in any weight from 18 to 250 grammes, and then conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
in strips of equal size to the mould previously mentioned. As far
as cleanliness, purity, and easy management are concerned, it fulfills
all the demands which can be expected of the most modern
machine.</p>

</div>

<p>The pieces of chocolate, on emerging from the dividing processes,
are placed separately in iron moulds, that is to say, as far
as this has not already been done in the dividing machine. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
important that these should have the same temperature as the chocolate
mass, in order to prevent the formation of spots on the surface
of the cakes, and to obtain a good and non-greyish fracture. The
temperature for moulding smaller objects can be fixed at between
27° and 32° C. and for the larger may be considerably lower. In
summer also, moulding may be proceeded with at a lower temperature
than in winter. According to a note in the Gordian (1895,
No. 4) the moulding may be carried out in summer, when the
atmospheric temperature is;</p>

<ul><li>from 25-31° C, at 26-27·5° C</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"&nbsp; 18·5-25° C, at 28·5-30° C</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"&nbsp; 12·5-18·5° C, at 31-32·5° C</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In cold weather, the cakes may be moulded at a temperature of from
32·5-35° C., according to their thickness. When not manufactured
in the automatic machine shown in fig. 48, the mass should be
otherwise controlled as regards temperature, which should be
registered by a thermometer introduced therein. The moulds are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
for the most part filled with plastic and liquid chocolates, and their
depths determined and modified by the weight of material which
they are destined to receive.</p>

<p>Fig. 52 shows a machine which conducts the semi-fluid mass
to the moulds in the following manner. The moulds are automatically
introduced under the apparatus, and filled from the small stirrer
above. They then succeed to the shaking table and are finally transported
to the cooling room. On this machine moulds of from
75-350 mm long and 75-225 mm broad can safely be employed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are two different forms in which chocolate is sold,
namely, that intended for domestic purposes, and that which is to
be consumed as an article of luxury. The kinds known as cake,
rock and roll chocolate belong to the first class, the several pieces
weighing 50, 100, 200, 250, 500 up to 5000 grammes. Tin-plate is the
only material of which moulds are made; and these generally have
a capacity rather greater than is necessary for holding the particular
quantities to be moulded. The chocolate is therefore, as described
above, divided into given weights, and generally deposited direct in
the moulds by the dividing machine. The divided portions of chocolate
are pressed down in the moulds by hand, equally distributed in
the latter, and then transferred in the moulds to the shaking table or
combination of shaking tables to be described later. On the shaking
table the soft chocolate soon penetrates completely into all the corners
and impressions of the stamped tin moulds. The removal of the
cooled cakes from the moulds is easily effected by pressing.</p>

<p>These moulds are generally provided with from four to ten
ridges or indentations, so that the chocolate can be conveniently
divided, and as required for use. Others again have a similar number
of compartments.</p>

<p>The compartments may be impressed with any kind of
inscription, so that such information as the name of a firm can always
be reproduced on the cakes.</p>

<p>Broken chocolate is generally of inferior quality, brought on
the market without any protective covering.</p>

<p>In those kinds of chocolate which are known as articles of
luxury a distinction is to be made between;</p>

<p>1. Those moulds which are in one piece and completely filled
with chocolate, so that the superfluous mass can be removed by a
knife. In such cases the weight of the cakes is exactly regulated by
the capacity of the moulds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>2. Those intended for moulding various figures of fruit etc.
in which two or three parts make a closed space which is of the
form desired.</p>

<p>Among the moulds of the first type must be numbered those
used in the preparation of small tablets and sticks, and the sweetmeats
known as Napolitains and Croquettes.</p>

<p>The second class comprises moulds for making chocolate cigars
and chocolate eggs, and also the double moulds.</p>

<p>The moulds for the smaller tablets, cream sticks, napolitains
and croquettes are also made exclusively from tin-plate, and the separate
parts are enclosed in a stout iron frame, the top of which is
ground down smooth, so that any superfluous portion of the filling
can easily be scraped away. In that way from six to thirty pieces
can be cast in one mould at the same time: the cooled chocolate can
be released from the moulds by gently tapping one corner against
a table. In napolitain moulds protecting hooks are attached, to avoid
their sustaining any injury in this operation.</p>


<p>Examples of the more frequent moulds.</p>


<p class="center">1. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate Cigars.</em></p>

<p>These are made either by introducing the chocolate mass between
the two halves of a double mould, of which each corresponds
to a half of the cigar shape to be moulded and which each fit exactly
one on the other; or else by pouring it into hollow moulds stamped
out of one complete piece. Moulding presses<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> are utilised in
the manufacture of material <em class="gesperrt">en masse</em>. In these the cigars are
filled into iron moulds, afterwards held together by means of iron
combs, and so introduced in to the press. For each size and shape
special moulds and plates are essential. Neither barium sulphate nor
zinc white may be employed to produce an imitation of the ash on
ordinary cigars, as both are objected to by health inspectors; nor
are they necessary, for in phosphate of lime (tricalcium carbonate)
we possess a perfectly harmless and at the same time efficient substitute,
when it is mixed up with starch syrup.</p>

<p>Other figures, such as fish etc., may also be produced in chocolate,
by means of the moulding press, when it is furnished with
stamped moulds, corresponding to the forms required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>


<p class="center">2. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate eggs.</em></p>

<p>These are generally made hollow, unless they are very small,
by pressing chocolate in two halves of an egg-shaped mould and
then uniting the two parts. Another method patented by Th. Berger
of Hamburg<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> seems less practical. A mould is made of soft sheet
caoutchouc blown out; this is dipped into liquid chocolate and, after
the adhering coating has hardened, the air is let out of the mould.
The use of caoutchouc moulds would render this method too costly,
since the alternation of temperature soon makes the caoutchouc
unserviceable.</p>


<p class="center">3. <em class="gesperrt">Various figures, fruits, animals, and other small
objects.</em></p>

<p>Double moulds are used for making these objects in chocolate,
consisting sometimes of three or four parts; they are made either
of sheet iron, tinned, or, for more complicated forms, the moulds
are cast in tin, but these latter are not so durable as those of tinned
sheet iron with strong iron frames.</p>

<p>The several parts of the moulds, after having soft chocolate
mass pressed into them, are put together and excess of material
is removed by requisite pressure by the use of a press of the kind
made by A. Reiche in Dresden, which will admit of a large number
of moulds being placed in it at a time. By the use of such a press
the moulds are protected from injury, and the objects moulded have
a better appearance, as a result of the uniform as well as strong
pressure exerted.</p>

<p>After cooling, the moulded objects are readily detached from
the moulds and they only require to be scraped clean, or further
ornamented as may be desired. That is done in various ways, for
example by painting with coloured cacao butter.</p>


<p class="center">4. <em class="gesperrt">Crumb Chocolate.</em></p>

<p>This term is applied to the small pieces of chocolate of
truncated conical shape, with from 4 to 5 smooth surfaces. They are
made by a machine specially constructed for the purpose by A. Reiche
(No. 1550); it consists of a four-cornered box with a removable bottom.
Inside the box there is a false bottom, from 1 to 2 cm above the other
bottom, which is fitted with a removable sheet iron plate, in which
pentagonal holes are stamped. A knife can be introduced at one cor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>ner
of the bottom of the box. After sufficient chocolate has been
made to penetrate through the pentagonal holes by agitating the
box on the table, the knife is rapidly drawn across the bottom and
the box raised up. The sheet iron plate is then taken out, and by
gently tapping one corner the small pieces of chocolate are
shaken out.</p>


<p class="center">5. <em class="gesperrt">Small tablets, sticks, fruits or figures filled
with cream.</em></p>

<p>These are prepared by pouring the cream contents in either
wooden or iron moulds, previously dusted with a little flour, and then
moulding round them chocolate in whatever form is required, always
taking care that this is kept as soft and plastic as possible, a suitable
addition of cacao butter proving invaluable for the purpose.</p>

<p>In former times chocolate moulds were manufactured exclusively
in France, where the firm Létang of Paris enjoyed what was
to all intents and purposes a world monopoly. But since the year
1870 the oft-mentioned firm of Reiche in Dresden-Plauen has taken
up the manufacture, and has succeeded in conquering the market in
a remarkably short time. The moulds of this firm satisfy each and
every possible requirement, although it would be no disadvantage
if the old type of pattern mould were cleared away at one and the
same time with the old routine, to make room for a little artistic skill
and embellishment.</p>

<p>Recently Reiche has brought out a special machine intended as
an easy and practical cleanser of his many moulds, which include
bonbon cutters and cutting rollers, numbering stamps, chocolate
slicers, roller machine boxes etc. He has lately brought on to the
market a special machine for quickly and efficiently cleaning the
moulds, which is illustrated in fig. 53.</p>

<p>In one end, a circular brush is introduced, and against this the
moulds to be cleaned are firmly pressed. In consequence of the
large number of revolutions which this brush passes through, the
moulds are cleansed of still adhering masses of chocolate in a half
or third of the time occupied when hand labour is employed. At the
other end of the shaft occurs a duster, sprinkled with Vienna white
(a lime), which polishes off the moulds previously and thoroughly
cleaned by the circular brush. The great advantage of this machine
is that the daily expenditure on polishing is considerably reduced
One girl can do the work of two hand workers, when this machine
is employed. In addition, it makes possible a continual touching up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
of the material used in the making of the moulds, a ventilating apparatus
removing all traces of dust.</p>

<h5>12. <em class="gesperrt">The Shaking Table.</em></h5>

<p>The pasty chocolate mass fills itself into the chocolate moulds
spontaneously, in consequence of its soft consistency. Yet to share
it evenly throughout the mould, so that it adapts itself to every bend
and hollow there occurring, and further to bring to the surface any
possible bubbles of air evident in the mass, the chocolate is whilst
still in the moulds subjected to brisk shaking.</p>

<p>This is effected by placing the chocolate on trays and transferring
these to the shaking table, of which types and construction
are at the present time manifold and various, the best and oldest being
given in front elevation below (Fig. 54).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The movable slab <b>a</b>, fitted with an upright rim at its edges,
has underneath two projecting pieces <b>d</b>, working against deeply toothed
wheels <b>e</b>, which fastened on the shaft <b>b</b>, are driven round by
the pulleys <b>c</b>. The teeth of the wheels catch on the projecting pieces
at every revolution of the shaft and push them rather gently on one
side, and when the tooth-points slide from under the slab, it drops
down as much as it has been previously raised. Each tooth of the
wheel coming into contact with the projections, the same motion
is repeated several times, causing the slab to oscillate up and down.</p>

<p>This oscillation of the slab is controlled by means of a hand
lever <b>f</b>, occurring on the shaft <b>g</b>, and fixed crosswise thereon, so that
we can only show it in cross section on the diagram. The lever <b>f</b>
attaches itself to the under part of the slab, raises it, and so throws
the wheels out of contact with the projecting pieces, but without
stopping the rotation of the shaft <b>b</b>.</p>

<p>Shaking tables have also witnessed considerable improvements
with the lapse of time, and we shall now proceed to treat these in
more detail, especially as several recent constructions offer and
illustrate many interesting mechanical points.</p>

<p>An old type of machine, that is nevertheless still much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
employed, is illustrated in fig. 55. Here the slab is caused to osculate
by shaking wheels introduced underneath, each possessing six, eight,
or more teeth. The slab is raised and lowered by contact with wedge-shaped
parts, the effect produced being greater or less according as
the moulds are large or small, heavy or light, and in proportion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the consistency of the chocolate mass which they contain, e. g.
whether it is solid or semi-liquid.</p>

<p>Quite an improved construction is shown in fig. 56. Here the
table is attached to a vertical axle, which is moved up and down by
means of a toothed wheel fixed on its bottom end. There is also a
cylinder arrangement under the whole machine to assist in controlling
the vertical motion of the shaft, and as it is provided with
automatic lubrication, there is no danger of any wearing out of the
apparatus and consequent irregularity of functioning.</p>

<p>The shaking and jerking of the slabs is in itself attended by a
considerable amount of noise, and when to this is added that caused
by the tables, it will be seen that a chocolate factory may become to
its neighbours a very serious source of objection. For years attempts
have therefore been made to construct shaking tables, so that they
would not cause any greater noise than is absolutely inevitable.
Pneumatic contrivances and caoutchouc have met with right royal
success in this connection.</p>

<p>The most recent and probably the most perfectly constructed
shaking table is given in figs. 57 and 57 a. It embodies all the latest
improvements and is self lubricating, a fact of the highest importance
as releasing the strain on the attendance, which would need to be
very perfect to ensure absence of noise in the case of a machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
making 800 strokes a minute. When it is considered that the moulding
room is generally managed by girls who neither possess knowledge
of, nor interest in, the machines, the advantages of such automatic
lubrication become even more apparent.</p>

<p>Apart from the automatic lubrication, in itself a sufficient
guarantee for the efficiency of the machine, screws and nuts are
entirely avoided on this machine. The motive mechanism is also
interesting. By a special arrangement, the number of revolutions in
relation to the number of the elevations of the slab is reduced to one
fourth, viz., from 760 to 190. Since the elevation of the slab can be
regulated to zero, a loose pulley for shifting the driving belt is
unnecessary; in addition, the driving shaft makes only a small number
of revolutions, and works in oil. The round shaped upright serves
to carry the vertically moving frame <b>i</b>, which supports the slab
moving in an oiled groove at <b>s</b>, and which is supported underneath by
the pivot <b>m</b>. Both at <b>m</b> and <b>s</b> there is automatic lubrication. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
bearings of the spindle <b>n</b>, attached to the upright, work into left and
right screw threads at <b>oo</b>, to which points the ends of a broad leather
belt <b>p</b> are attached, passing over the roller <b>g</b>, by which the
frame <b>i</b> is suspended. The driving pulley <b>k</b>, running in oil, carries in
its centre the four rollers <b>l</b>, which turn round and round the pulley <b>k</b>,
so as to come into contact with the belt <b>p</b> and press it outwards on
both sides. At the same time it shortens the belt in the vertical axle,
so raising up the table slab <b>i</b>. This is repeated four times by one
revolution of the driving pulley, so that working with 190 revolutions
a minute, the slab is raised 760 times. According as the screws <b>oo</b>
are moved to or from the centre, the vertical movement of the slab
can be increased or decreased to a point when the slab is completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
out of action, i. e. when the rollers l no longer touch the belt <b>p</b>. Under
favourable local conditions, a number of such tables can be driven
by one shaft, so that only one pulley and a single driving belt would
be needed, though each table would work quite independently of the
others. Such an arrangement is shown in figures 58 and 58 a.</p>

</div>

<p>This shaking table, though only recently introduced, has quickly
made itself popular, and is especially suitable for the preparation of
readily liquefiable chocolate. The gentle vibratory motion produced
by this shaking table and its exact adjustability admit of the
thinnest cakes being made in a perfectly uniform thickness, without
any objectionable projections round their edges. Besides the shaking
tables of this construction there are others made in such a way that
whether the moulds are light or heavy, small or large, the slab is
always raised to the same height, the working of the slab being adjusted
by altering the number of revolutions. The manipulation of
these tables is much more difficult than that of tables constructed as
above described, and that is probably the reason why these have
for decades been scarce on the market.</p>

<p>The moulded chocolate spread out on trays is transferred as
rapidly as possible to the cooling chamber, with which we shall
conclude section IV.</p>

<p>Instead of several shaking tables alternately receiving the
moulds, which involve frequent changes, so-called shaking systems
(fig. 58b) have been generally adopted of late. They consist of a number
of shaking tables, having their frames attached to each other, possessing
a common motor control, and having their slabs arranged one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
after the other in such a way that the filled moulds slowly proceeding
from the dividing machine can be automatically conducted over them.
The shaken moulds are then passed on to further processes, or they
enter the cooling chambers at once. The advantage of the shaking
table system lies in a reduction of the number of hands, who only
need to be in attendance at each end of the system, and further in the
regularity, both as regards time and strength, which prevails in
connection with the shaking of each mould.</p>


<h5>13. <em class="gesperrt">Cooling the chocolate.</em></h5>

<p>Experience has shown that the more rapidly the moulded chocolate
is cooled the finer is its texture and the more uniform the
appearance of the fractured surface. That is due to the formation of
smaller crystals of the fat when the cooling is rapid, while in slow
cooling larger crystals are formed and the fracture consequently becomes
dull and greyish.</p>

<p>Formerly it was possible to distinguish chocolate made in
summer from that made in winter by the more uniform appearance
of the fracture, that was, in the latter case, the result of more rapid
cooling.</p>

<p>At present, however, manufacturers are no longer dependent
upon favorable atmospheric conditions in that respect, for by suitable
arrangements it is now possible to produce the reduced temperature
requisite by artificial means.</p>

<p>The most suitable cooling chamber is an underground space
which should, however, be so situated as to be in convenient communication
with the moulding room. The cheapest and simplest
place for a cooling chamber is a cellar, if it be properly constructed
and dry, as well as large enough to contain the quantity of
chocolate made in one day’s working. The best temperature to be
kept up ranges from 8° to 10° C. Within those limits there is no
danger of the chocolate being coated with moisture, or that it will
acquire a coarse grained texture by lying too long. The following
rules will serve for guidance in regard to this point:</p>

<p>Generally, chocolate presents the finest fracture when it has
been fully levigated and when it contains a considerable amount of
fat, provided that the fat present is only cacao butter. Those kinds
which are not so well levigated, or have had some addition of foreign
fat of higher melting point, show an inferior fracture. It is possible
to obtain an equally vitreous fracture in a less cold cellar (16° C. and
upwards) when the chocolate is moulded at a temperature correspon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>ding
to that of the cellar; to effect that, the chocolate should be
moulded at a proportionally lower temperature the warmer the
cellar is. The difference can be seen by the appearance of pale red
spots on the surface. When it is desired to dispense with artificial
cooling, the cellar should be as much as possible below the surface of
the ground; it should also be of sufficient height, not less than 3 m.
If the situation and height of the cellar be properly adjusted, the
requisite area for disposing of a daily production amounting to 5000
kilos would be 400 sq. m. The cellar must be well ventilated and
furnished with double windows, so placed as to open towards the
north and east. Discharges of warm waste water, as well as steam
pipes or furnaces should be kept as far distant from the cellar as
possible. The internal arrangement of the cellar should be of such
a nature that the whole of the chocolate to be cooled can be deposited
upon the floor, since that is the place where cooling takes place most
rapidly. With that object in view it is desirable to construct brickwork
pillars about 25 cm high, covered with white tiles. Passages
are arranged between these pillars. The cellar should be entered
by as few persons as possible and, therefore, the cooled cakes of
chocolate should be taken at once, in the moulds, to an adjoining
room to be turned out and passed on to the packing room and store.</p>

<p>Most of the existing factories, that have been established for
any time (large and small) have had to adopt artificial means of
cooling, because in most instances the quantity of chocolate to be
cooled daily has, in course of time, increased tenfold. The machine
rooms have been enlarged, the number of machines has also been
increased, while the cooling cellar has remained in its formerly modest
proportions. But those circumstances are not the only reasons for
having recourse to artificial refrigeration, which is often necessary
in consequence of the inconvenient situation of the cellar and the
high underground water level.</p>

<p>In the application of artificial refrigeration in a chocolate factory
it is not advisable to hasten the cooling of large quantities by
producing too low a temperature in small chambers. The cakes of
chocolate mass by that means come out of the moulds as hard as
glass, but it is questionable whether the consumer using the chocolate
many months afterwards, will make the same observation. Great
care would have to be taken with such rapidly cooled chocolate, to
pass it gradually through chambers of a medium temperature and
thus prepare it for exposure in the packing rooms and warehouses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Even when employing artificial means for cooling, the reduction of
the cellar temperature and cooling upon pillars is to be preferred to
the more direct cooling upon a system of pipes, which after all is
nothing else than a cooling upon ice, as may be in some instances
the only alternative. Consequently, a well constructed cellar for
cooling, furnished with a system of cooling pipes on the roof is perhaps
the most advantageous arrangement, especially for large
factories.</p>

<p>In carrying out artificial refrigeration various kinds of machines
are used for reducing temperature, in which the desired effect
is produced either directly by the condensation and evaporation of
suitable materials, such as liquid carbonic acid, ammonia, sulphurous
acid, or indirectly by making saline solutions (calcium chloride), cooled
below the freezing point, circulate through a system of pipes fitted on
the roof or walls of the space to be cooled. As the cold liquid is
pumped through the pipes, it takes up heat from the air in contact
with them, correspondingly reducing the temperature of the cooling
chamber. The cooling installations of the firm of C. G. Haubold, junior,
Chemnitz, are among the best and have long been extensively used in
the chocolate industry. Their cooling apparatus is a compressing
machine, in which coolness is obtained by the evaporation and recondensation
of such liquid gases as carbonic acid or ammonia. Like
all compressing machines, it is comprised of three main parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="hangsection">
<p>I. The evaporator or refrigerator, consisting of a wrought iron
system of pipes. The latter are placed in the spaces of the plant
to be cooled, with a so-called direct evaporation arrangement,
and are either arranged on the walls and ceiling, or built in a
special chamber as dry or moist air coolers, according to the
quality of the chocolate to be cooled, or the use for which it is
destined. Whilst in the former case cooling is effected directly
in the rooms, in the latter the air of the cooling room is conducted
to the air coolers by means of ventilator, in order to be
cooled and dried there, and then again introduced in the chamber.</p>

<p>II. The compressor, a gas suction and pressure pump, working both
simply and complex, which draws the refrigerating medium out
of the evaporator, compresses it, and forces it along to the condenser.</p>

<p>III. This condenser consists of a coil of wrought iron or copper pipes,
which are enclosed in a barrel and are often described as the
immersion condenser. There is another type, in which the pipes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
are united to one or more pipe-walls, introduced in a vessel which
collects and drains off the condensations. In both cases the coil
of pipes is played upon by a continual stream of water, in order
that the gases which they contain may be condensed. The
immersion condenser is generally employed when there is a
plentiful supply of cheap water at hand, and the other in contrary
cases. This latter condenser is provided with a separate
liquid “after-cooler”, constructed on analogy with the before
mentioned immersion condenser. The counter current principle
holds good in both types, and admits of a better using up of the
cooling water. The liquid gas then passes on to the evaporator,
where it is responsible for further refrigeration.</p></div></blockquote>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 59a.</div>
</div>

<p>The refrigerator also occurs in the form of a brine cooler. In
this construction the evaporating pipes are likewise enclosed in a
barrel, containing a high percentage of salt brine. In consequence of
the refrigerating apparatus occurring on the interior of the pipes,
the brine contained therein is cooled down to a very low temperature,
pumped along to the cooling chambers, and after delivering its alloted
refrigeration unit re-conducted to the cooling apparatus, where it is
once more subjected to the same series of processes.</p>

<p>A well-known arrangement for such artificial refrigeration is
that constructed by Wegelin &amp; Hübner at Halle o. S., in which carbonic
acid is employed, and it has been found well adapted for use in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
chocolate factories. The accompanying illustrations figures 59 a and
59 b represent an arrangement of that kind in which the cooling is
effected on cooling trays judiciously arranged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" alt="Fig. 59b." />
</div>


<p>The refrigerating machine is constructed on the carbonic acid
gas compression system; it consists of 1. the compressing pump <b>a</b>,
2. the condenser <b>b</b>, and 3. the system of pipes <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>, that constitute
the refrigerator. The coil of pipes in the refrigerator is connected at
one extremity with the compressing pump and at the other extremity
with the condenser. Liquid carbonic acid passes from the condenser
into the coil of pipes and is there evaporated. The heat necessary
for that change is withdrawn, either directly or indirectly, from the
cooling chamber and from the chocolate placed in it, until the desired
reduction of temperature is brought about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 60.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>The compressing pump <b>a</b> is a peculiarly constructed suction
and pressure pump, it draws out of the refrigerating pipes the
vaporised carbonic acid by which they have been cooled and then
subjects it to a pressure which helps to effect its reconversion into
the liquid state.</p>

<p>The condenser <b>b</b> consists of a coil of pipes over which a
current of cold water is kept flowing and the compressed carbonic
acid vapour, passing from the compressor into these pipes, is there
cooled and condensed by the surrounding water, so as to be transferred
back to the refrigerator through a valve fitted to it for that
purpose. The outer vessel of the condenser is constructed of cast-iron,
in one piece with the compressor frame. These cooling arrangements
are constructed either with or without mechanical ventilators.
In figures 63 a and 63 b the compressing pump and condenser are
represented as placed on the ground floor, while the refrigerator
is situated in the cellar space lying beside them and at a lower level,
in such a manner that both the systems of cooling pipes are not
situated upon the roof of the cellar, but run along it at regular
distances parallel to the side walls of the cellar. The compressor
and condenser form one apparatus and the former is driven by a
steam engine.</p>

<p>In the cooling cellar, the refrigerator is generally fixed to the
walls in such a way that the warm chocolate, taken into the cellar,
can be at once placed upon the stages formed by the system of
cooling pipes, and so there is some advantage in having the system
of cooling pipes fitted along the roof of the cellar.</p>

<p>The machine which is diagrammed in fig. 60 possesses an
hourly output of some 70000 calories, measured in salt water at
-5 ° C. The compressor is driven directly by an electric motor,
and a stirring apparatus is put in motion by the crankshaft of the
compressor, the two being connected by an intermediate gearing.</p>

<p>Wegelin and Hübner put out cooling plants with salt water
cooling, smaller and medium sized plants are on the contrary provided
with so-called direct evaporation.</p>

<p>The diagram in fig. 61 shows an air-cooler as built of late by
Esher, Wyss &amp; Co. for chocolate cooling plants.</p>

<p>These air coolers are especially used for direct evaporation
of carbonic acid gas. They consist of three groups of ribbed wrought-iron
pipes, the whole constituting a system supported in a frame
work of U-shaped and angular iron. The separate tubes are welded
and bent together. The ribbed bodies are in themselves square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
shaped, and apart from the tube opening have a nozzle introduced in
their centre, which pressed firmly against the press pipe effects a
favourable transmission of heat in the case of large surface areas
of the support, the more so as the tubes are square shaped.</p>

<p>Among the numerous advantages of this machine can be
numbered the abolition of the refrigerator and brine pump, prompt
and instantaneous refrigeration when the machine is started, and
ease of control, as a flange connection occurs immediately in front
of the machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 61.</div>
</div>

<p>A wrought iron trough is fitted up underneath the air-cooler to
catch the water drops. Above, and to the left, the three systems
of the air-cooler are connected by means of a catch.</p>

<p>In the foreground of the illustration is given a miniature of
the ribbed tube system, which very clearly illustrates the arrangement
of the separate ribs.</p>

<p>A ventilator not apparent on the diagram conducts air to
the tubes in the cooling chamber, and these present a considerable
cooling area, in addition to which, the air-stream taking a parallel
direction, resistance to its passage is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Another method of cooling<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>, that is carried out in France
consists in placing the moulds, containing cakes of chocolate, upon
a travelling belt running horizontally through the whole length of
the cooling chamber. The requisite reduction of temperature is
effected by apparatus similar to that described above in Wegelin &amp;
Hübner’s arrangement. The liquefied carbonic acid flows through a
system of pipes fitted to the roof of the cooling chamber, producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
by its vaporisation the necessary cooling and then it passes back
to the refrigerating machine. Circulation of the air in the cooling
chamber is provided for by a suitable ventilator under the pipes
of the cooling system, gutters being fixed to carry away any water
condensing upon their surface and prevent it from falling upon the
chocolate. The travelling belt passes along so slowly that the
moulds, containing chocolate, placed upon it at one end, take from
ten to fifteen minutes in passing to the other end where they are
taken off and carried to the packing rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_170.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 62.</div>
</div>

<p>Another cooling arrangement that works very well is constructed
by T. &amp; W. Cole of the Park Road Iron Works, London E.;
figure 62, represents a plan of this arrangement, which has the great
advantage of providing for the exclusion of moisture from the
cooling chamber. Refrigeration is effected, by means of Cole’s Arctic-Patent
Dry Cold Air machines, by compressing atmospheric air and
then allowing it to expand, after being cooled by water and having
moisture removed by suitable arrangements. The machine is of
very solid construction; it works at a pressure of from 70 to 80
atmospheres and drives the dry cooled air through a system fitted
in the cooling chamber where the chocolate is spread out, either on
portable trucks or on a travelling belt, so that it remains in the
chamber long enough to become perfectly cold. The system of
cooling can be changed in various ways. The sudden removal of the
cold chocolate into another chamber where the air is moist, would
be attended with a deposition of water upon the goods. For that
reason the goods are first transferred, for a short time, to a warm
chamber (ante-room) where they acquire a temperature at which no
deposition of moisture can take place. The chief advantage of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
arrangement is that it furnishes dry cold air economically, both in
summer and also in a moist climate. Cole guarantees that this machine
will effect a refrigeration of 5 ° C.; according to the statement of
Messrs. Negretti and Zambra the cooled air contains only 40 % of
moisture. The cold air from one of these machines can be led, by a
well insulated run of pipes, to any part of the factory and thus be made
available for cooling purposes in different places.</p>

<p>The cooling plants hitherto described may be classified as “Space
Coolers”, because in each case a special compartment of the cooling
chamber must be utilised. The increased prices of estate constitute
no mean objection to such a system.</p>

<p>A critical valuation of these plants brings out a few undisguisable
deficiencies. A large proportion of the cold is lost in the
chamber itself, before it has been of any avail; and then again the
rooms are generally insufficiently, sometimes even not at all, insulated
from adjacent and warmer chambers, which once more involves
raising of the low temperature essential in the process.<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Detrimental
also is the presence of the personnel, the illuminations, and many
minor influences. It is evident that the larger the output required
the larger must the cooling chamber be, involving corresponding
economical waste.</p>

<p>With the recognition of these evils arose the problem of their
abolition. The aim was to employ small chambers and avoid loss of
cold air. It is now solved by a system already used in many and
various industries, namely, cooling in closets. Larger or smaller
closets may be employed, as required, and in consequence of their
thorough insulation may even be introduced into the warmest rooms.
Their principle is maximum efficiency with minimum occupation of
space, and avoidance of loss of cold as far as possible. In consequence
of this latter aim, the refrigerators in this case can be
constructed on a smaller scale than those destined for an equal output
of material, which are fixed up in cooling chambers; or they may
be larger, which is yet more important, for the efficiency of the
machine under consideration can be considerably increased by
connecting it with one of the closets.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of cooling chambers, those which transport
the moulds automatically, and those which contain layers where the
moulds are placed one over another. Both types are cooled by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
circulation of air, so effected, that cooled air currents are sucked up
by a fan out of a tubular system fitted underneath a horizontal partition,
and then forced along to the chambers above, where they are
evenly distributed over the rows of sheet-iron, laden with moulds, or
where they play upon the travelling belt which transports the moulds
out of the cooling chambers. The air passes once more into the tube
chamber on the opposite side, where it delivers up the warmth it has
in the meantime acquired, to enter finally the same system of circulation
as before. The general temperature of the closets is a mean
between 8 ° C. and 10 ° C., and the cooling lasts from 20-40 minutes,
according to the strength and size of the tablets. As the temperature
never goes lower than 8 ° C., it is impossible for the tablets to become
moist when exposed to the warmer outer atmosphere. Fig. 63a
shows a Cooling Chamber built by J. M. Lehmann, which is adapted
for a daily output of some 1000 kilos, and divided into compartments
one above the other. The sections of this chamber, which in the
illustration plainly shows the small amount of space required for its
erection, are divided by vertical cross-partitions into four compartments,
each of which is provided with a shelf or stand to take a
charge of 10 cooling trays, and accessible by three spring-doors, thus
giving as small apertures as possible and reducing the loss of cold
when charging to a minimum. In addition to this, each compartment
is fitted with a contrivance for regulating and, if necessary, completely
cutting of the draught. The position of the system of pipes is shown
by the two pipe-ends to which it is connected. On the opposite side,
or front of the chamber, is the fan-drive, either a small electric motor,
or shafting. The perforated cooling trays are visible through the
open doors. The sides of the chamber consist of two layers of wood
with thick slabs of cork between them. All chambers of this system,
including those with automatic conveyance of the moulds, can be
taken to pieces for transport, the single pieces afterwards only requiring
to be fastened together again when erecting the chamber.—The
chamber illustrated serves for cooling moulded chocolate. For
pralinés and the like similar chambers are supplied, which are,
however, smaller and lighter in construction.</p>

<p>Fig. 63b represents a cooling chamber with forced air circulation
and automatic conveyance of the moulds, built by the same
firm. This chamber, which, owing to the travelling belt conveying
the moulds, is of considerable length, is nowhere connected with the
outside air; the whole manipulation of the moulds is carried on
through small adjustable openings at the points where the travelling
band enters and leaves the chamber. The band consists of chains
in links on to which wooden laths are screwed and its speed can be
regulated to suit the size of the tables to be dealt with. The width
of the belt and chamber can at any time be varied to suit the place of
erection and correspond with the length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>As is to be seen from the illustration, this cooling chamber requires
the minimum of attendance and thus complies with the principles
lately adopted in all large factories, in which the tendency is
to substitute as much as possible mechanical appliances for manual
work. It will be seen from the preceding chapters that this tendency
is especially marked in the moulding department, where automatic
tempering, moulding and mould-filling plants and shaking tables have
already been introduced. In order to utilise fully such automatic
plants the last link in the chain only was wanting, namely, a suitable
means of transferring the moulds from the shaking tables to the cooling
chamber and through the latter to the demoulding and packing
room. The purpose of the cooling chamber above described is to
fill up this gap, and its proper place is thus ranged in among the automatic
machinery described.</p>

<p>Thus it is that many modern factories have united the above
machines to form a single working plant, as shown by Groundplan
Fig. 63c.</p>


<h4>V. Special Preparations.</h4>


<h5>a) <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate Lozenges and Pastilles.</em></h5>

<p>These chiefly consist of cacao mass, sugar and spices. Formerly
they were made by placing the semi-liquid chocolate material
on a stone slab, furnished with a rim of uniform height which served
to regulate the thickness of the goods manufactured, and then
rolling out the mass as required. The lozenges were punched from
the rolled-out layer by means of a cutter. After allowing the mass to
cool, these lozenges were detached from the remaining portions, which
were then rolled again and the same process repeated.</p>

<p>Pastilles, on the surface of which impressions of varying import,
such as figures, names, firms etc. are required, may also be manufactured
by placing the soft chocolate mass upon tin-plates in which
depressions occur corresponding to the device desired. A roller is
employed to make the material fit into the depressions, and superfluous
chocolate is removed with a knife.</p>

<p>These impressions come out especially fine, when the pastille<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
moulds are subjected to a shaking on the tables with which we are
already acquainted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 64.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_177a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 65.</div>
</div>

<p>Yet these processes are becoming obsolete, and the chocolate
slabs or plates are at the present time superseded by the two forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
of apparatus constructed by A. Reiche, which we accordingly describe
below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_178.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 66.</div>
</div>

<p>In the first of these simply constructed machines, fig. 64, the
material oozes through perforations in a square sieve-like arrangement,
at length issuing on the sheet-iron plate fitted underneath. The
process is aided by repeated shaking, and when sufficient chocolate
has penetrated to the plate, the box is raised on its hinge and chocolate
mass left ready for further treatment. By gentle additional
shaking, the still irregular heaps are rounded off to perfection; they
are now cooled down and finally detached. The coating of the
lozenges with coloured sugar grains is effected by passing them,
together with the plate to which they still adhere, through a box
containing sugar dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>This machine is scarcely used now; in its place come the two
constructions of A. Reiche, as already stated, the one being intended
for solid material, and the other for semi-liquid chocolate mass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 67.</div>
</div>

<p>By means of his pastille machine Nr. 14091, which we give in
Figs. 65 and 66, chocolate lozenges of the most diverse size can
be prepared very rapidly and to advantage. The chocolate material,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
which in this case is solid, is pressed through perforations in a metal
plate and otherwise treated as in previous cases.</p>

<p>In working with this machine, it must be previously and sufficiently
warmed, then partially filled with chocolate material of a
proper consistency (not more than 75 % of the total capacity may be
utilised). It is highly important in the preparation of lozenges that the
material should neither be too hard nor too plastic, but strike a just
medium.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 68.</div>
</div>

<p>Before pressing down the plunger, worked by a screw, a
metal plate is laid upon the chocolate to prevent contact with the
plunger. By slight pressure, the chocolate mass is forced through the
perforations, according to the required size of the lozenges, but the
plunger must not be screwed down further. This will admit of the
plate on which the lozenges rest being drawn out and another
inserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 69.</div>
</div>

<p>To this machine belong the usual perforated plates <i>f</i>, Fig. 66 of
which there are three of different sizes for each machine, as shown by
figures <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i>, also the plates <i>d</i> used for making the perforated confections
which find their way to the Christmas Tree. These plates
are impressed with larger or smaller designs, and so make two different
sizes of goods possible. A third plate is supplied for the
manufacture of whole pieces (various varieties of chocolate croquette).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>The machine works smoothly and noiselessly and delivers
excellent products. If instead of the usual plain lozenges, such with
the name of a firm or other device are desired, the corresponding
impressions must be stamped out on the plate in which the chocolate
is received after being forced through the perforations. See fig. 66,
g, h, i.</p>

<p>Fig. 67 illustrates the pastille machine Nr. 14 178 for thin chocolate
mass, constructed by A. Reiche (German Patent 227 200). It
resembles the foregoing apparatus in principle and appearance, being
only distinguished by a different aim, namely the treatment of thin
material. Used in conjunction with the peculiar moulds also manufactured
by the same firm (marked “Durabula”), even the deepest
impressions can be effected with an enormous saving of time and
material and in a most practical manner, as will be seen on comparing
figs. 69 <i>a</i> to <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>In order to get the full value out of this machine, some little
practice is necessary on the part of the workman in charge. But
possessed of an average amount of skill, he can soon turn out with this
apparatus ten times as much as can be made with the ordinary type
of lozenge machine.</p>

<p>For a favourable accommodation of the different pastille plates,
the hurdle diagrammed in fig. 68 (by A. Reiche) is quite excellent. It
is manufactured out of one complete sheet of steel, is free from any
suspicion of soldering, and entirely galvanised. It thus offers a
strong guarantee as regards wear and tear. It may also be advantageously
employed as a transporting device.</p>


<h5>b) <em class="gesperrt">Coated chocolates, pralinés etc.</em></h5>

<p>These delicacies are now held in high esteem, and of late the
consumption of pralinés and cheaper forms with imitative contents
has increased very considerably.</p>

<p>The designation praliné (properly pronounced prahlin) has
been applied to sugar-coated almonds and is derived from the name
of a cook in the employ of Marshal du Plessis, which was Pralins.
This “chef” belonged to the age of Louis XIV. and was the first to
make these sweetmeats. But now the term is applied to sweetmeats
of various forms, soft fruit-sugar, marmalade, cream, nut-paste etc.
respectively enveloped in chocolate. The special formulae employed
in the preparation of different kinds of pralinés are comprised in the
confectioner’s art, and do not need to be dealt with here.</p>

<p>The substances themselves are called fondants. Formerly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
sugar was boiled, placed upon a slab, and there manipulated with a
spatula, an operation difficult to manage, indeed almost impossible in
the last stages. In consequence of the increased demand for such
preparations, machines were introduced several years ago whereby
the operation is mechanically performed. Such a machine is shown
in fig. 70.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 70.</div>
</div>

<p>The bed-plate as well as all the working parts of the machine
are constructed of stout copper. The working parts admit of being
raised or lowered by means of the hand-wheel above, and they
remain fixed whilst the bed-plate turns and its underside is played
upon by water. The machine is capable of working up pure fondant
without any syrup addition, as well as that made up with syrup. The
boiled sugar is poured on the bed-plate of the fondant machine, cooled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
down from 10-20 minutes according to the syrup content, and to
such an extent that the machine can be set in motion, whilst the
working parts are gradually lowered to the previously mentioned
bed-plate. The sugar poured out is then cooled by means of the
action of a ventilator fitted on a crossbeam, occurring in the middle
of the wooden cooler, and working in conjunction with the ventilator,
in consequence whereof a cooling current of air is brought to strike
the hot sugar centrally.—When pure sugar is used, the fondant is
finished within six minutes, but in the case of a syrup addition the
time required is lengthened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 71.</div>
</div>

<p>A quite recent type of fondant machine is given in fig. 71.
It achieves its end by employing an air-current and a cylinder
with screw, which is provided with water cooling apparatus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
The <i>modus operandi</i> presents many and obvious advantages,
chief among which is the possibility of conducting new material
to the machine uninterruptedly, and further the preservation of the
flavour of the chocolate worked up. The result is a production of
first-class quality in respect to taste and flavour, which is quite ready
to be passed on to the next processes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 72.</div>
</div>

<p>The fondant is then diluted with colouring matter in boiling
pans, and so prepared for subsequent treatment. The figures which
have to be poured in are then transferred to gypsum moulds, lined
with starch powder, and the fondant sugar is in its turn poured over
these either by means of pans held in the hand or such as are machine-driven.
Hand-pouring postulates a considerable amount of skill on the
part of the man in charge, especially when even weights of the sepa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>rate
pieces are required. We annex an illustration of a motor-driven
depositing machine (fig. 72).</p>

<p>The sugar is here introduced into receivers heated by means
of a water-bath. The receiving boxes are moved under the
outflow one after another, after having been dusted with powder and
filled with chocolate, whilst the adjustment of the weight of each
separate piece is effected by the operation of a very ingenious
mechanism, even from 0-8 grammes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 73.</div>
</div>

<p>After a stay of several hours in the drying room, the molten
figures are so hard that they can be raised out of the powder with
the aid of a shovel. Fig. 73 shows such a machine, whilst Fig. 74
illustrates a machine where the work goes on unbrokenly, and from
which the chocolate figures are removed with a shovel.</p>

<p>The sweetmeats are next dipped into liquified chocolate (covering
stuff) to coat them with a layer of that material. The mass
employed for this purpose must contain up to 15 % more butter than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
that used for ordinary chocolate, so that it may be kept soft long
enough for continuous working.<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> This is performed in the machine
fig. 75. On a bed-plate coming into contact with steam or cold
water, as required, occur rake-like stirrers, and a small ventilator
introduced above assists in cooling off the material. For the purpose
of discharging, there is an outlet on the rim of the pan. For
storage of the tempered coverings and also for occasional alleviations
with cacao butter, a machine illustrated in fig. 76 is utilised.</p>

</div>

<p>The dipping of pralinés for the purpose of coating them was
formerly carried out by means of a fork, the nucleus masses being
dropped into the coating material, taken out with a fork, and placed
upon metal plates. Various kinds of ornamentation were designed
by the same instrument. In the preparation of the higher priced
coated fondants, a similar method of procedure is still in vogue,
although such manipulation presupposes a high degree of skill on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
part of the mechanics are at the machine. For articles of more
general consumption, whether ornamented or not, machines have been
introduced for the purpose by divers manufacturers, some of which
function excellently. Two of that kind which in every way respond
to the calls made on them are here described, but we shall not waste
time and labour over the more complicated and expensive machines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_189a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 77.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_189b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 78.</div>
</div>


<p>The first method of coating fondants, patented by A. Reiche of Dresden-Plauen,
is not based on mechanical principles, but rather relies on a series of
small appliances, represented in fig. 77. The jacketed casing <i>a</i>, fig. 77 contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
water, and into it the pan containing coating material can be placed: that is
kept in a liquid condition by heating the water in the jacket by spirit lamps or
gas jets underneath. The adjoining vessel <i>b</i> is closed on all sides, filled with
water, and also kept warm in the same manner; it serves for the preparatory
warming of the objects to be coated, which are spread upon a wire network,
and for that purpose two of these wire frames can be hung upon the hooks
inside the box. The mass dropping from the wire frame is conveyed into the
covering box <i>a</i>, by means of a sheet of metal placed above it; <i>c</i> serves as an
apparatus for turning, and we give it on a larger scale in fig. 78.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 79.</div>
</div>

<p>The tracings <i>h</i> and <i>i</i> in fig. 79 show the cross section and top
view of the wire gratings, on which cylindrical and ball-shaped sugar
goods are deposited. The other two kinds of grating are illustrated
at <i>L</i> and <i>M</i> (fig. 80).</p>

<p>The size of the meshes of the sieve gratings depends on that of
the centres to be coated.</p>

<p>The method of covering is as follows:</p>

<p>The centres for the pralinés etc. are placed in the cavities of the
gratings, and, as soon as one of the gratings is full, the latter is covered
up by the fine-meshed grating the half of the cross-section of
which is shown in Fig. 79 and the full view in Fig. 80 (see K and N
respectively), K representing the cover-grating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>Both gratings are held simultaneously by the operator at their
handles and then dipped together in the liquid covering contained in
the vessel a, Fig. 77, after which the superfluous covering mass is
removed by knocking. The gratings are now deposited on the
mechanism C, Figs. 77 or 78, as the case may be, the top sieve removed
and a sheet of paper or a metal plate put in its place. It is
then turned by hand to the opposite side, the grating with the impressions
is removed and the cover centres are found lying in regular
order, and at regular distances apart, on the metal plate. The object
of the intervals between the covered centres is to prevent the running
together of the latter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_191.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80.</div>
</div>

<p>Beans and rings are only dipped up to the middle, and the
process repeated with the other half of the centre after the first half
has cooled. This ensures a pleasing, round appearance, and has
further the advantage that the cover grating need not be put on
during the operation. When dipping cylindrical or ball-shaped
centres, the grating K which has first been removed on dipping, is at
once transferred to the heater, to prevent it cooling and withdrawing
too much warmth from the covering material at the next immersion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>The dipping of pralinés etc. is exceedingly easy if the new
type of dipping machine is used, a full view of which is given in
Fig. 81 and which has the highly appreciable advantage of simultaneously
cooling the dipped centres. All the parts are, in the main,
worked by hand, only the shaking and stirring contrivances and the
cooling fan requiring to be driven by motor power. The middle
piece carries the actual dipping apparatus, underneath which the
tank holding the covering chocolate is fixed, while the lefthand sidepiece
serves for feeding; as many as four operators can be engaged
simultaneously at the latter, the work consisting of laying the centres
in the gratings corresponding to the mouldings desired. The construction
of these gratings is, in the main, similar to the stamped
trays of Anton Reiche, but they are not provided with handles and
are despatched along the guide-rails by hand. The filled grating is
then placed in a frame, which is dipped by means of a winch into
the liquid chocolate. The top grating on the dipping frame is adjustable,
and the object of this grating is to keep the centres down,
as without this arrangement some of the centres might rise to the
surface of the covering. The top grating is, before commencing to
dip, pushed over the filled grating with the centres and is thus immersed
with them. The frame having been removed, the shaker is put
in action to remove the superfluous material from both the gratings
and the centres. The grating is drawn out after use from below the
top grating and transferred to a book-shaped ejector, on one side
of which is a metal sheet covered with paper. The whole of the
centres are then discharged on to the sheet, by reversing the two
flap-sections.</p>

<p>The sheet containing the covered centres is then transferred
to the cooling apparatus at the right, in which it is gradually lowered
on a “paternoster” apparatus by turning round a handle. It is then
conducted to the left by an endless band, and finally discharged in a
cooled state by the machine. The ventilator should be supplied with
air from the cellars and is arranged to blow it out in the opposite
direction to the goods in the cooling apparatus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81.</div>
</div>

<p>The shape of the design-gratings is reproduced in high relief
on the goods, and it will therefore be readily understood that further
designs or fancy shapes can be made on the gratings. For the production
of semi-dipped goods or such as are dipped round and remain
uncovered at the bottom, a device is attached to the striking gear
which renders it possible to regulate the depth of each immersion at
will. The tank containing the covering material is surrounded by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
water-jacket, which is heated by steam. The heat of the water is
indicated by a thermometer. The receptacle containing the covering
can easily be drawn out towards the front. In addition to this, the
whole of the outside of the machine, which also constitutes a complete
water-jacket, is heated by steam, and finally the ejector. The
gratings containing the impressions are taken out of the ejector after
use and transferred to the feeding side to be used again, so that, at
the very most, four gratings are required for each design.</p>

<p>The daily output of the machine is 300-600 kilos, and the size
of the gratings 280 by 400 millimetres, the output naturally depending
on whether the machine is operated by two, three or more persons.</p>

<h3><a name="B_The_Manufacture_of_Cocoa_Powder_and" id="B_The_Manufacture_of_Cocoa_Powder_and">B. The Manufacture of Cocoa Powder and
“Soluble” Cocoa.</a></h3>


<h4>a. The various methods of disintegrating or opening up
the tissues of cacao.</h4>

<p>The comparatively high fat content of pure cacao, which would
deter certain persons, especially those suffering from stomach disorders,
from taking it, has given rise to the now extensive demand for
a cacao preparation containing a less amount of fat and the constituents
of which are capable of being easily assimilated in the human
organism. At the same time the desire to obtain a cacao preparation
easily capable of complete and uniform suspension in milk or water
may have played its part, as this quality, in consequence of which the
preparation can rapidly and without difficulty be rendered ready for
consumption, is obviously a great advantage. The best way to obtain
this appeared to be the pulverisation of the cacao, which, when
reduced to a powder, more readily satisfies the above conditions.
As, however, it was not possible to pulverise cacao which still contained
its full amount of natural fat, it became necessary to devote
attention to the operation of extracting the cacao butter. It is many
years since the first appearance of certain preparations in Germany
which went under the name of “Cacogna”, and which had been deprived
of their fat to the extent of 20-25 %. This problem, however,
was recognised and attempts and all manner of experiments made
to solve it at a much earlier period in Holland. The founder of the
well-known Dutch firm of J. C. van Houten &amp; Sons in Weesp, Mr.
C. J. van Houten, was the first to attempt the expression of the fat
from cacao (1828) and to treat it with chemical agents with a view
to opening up or bringing about the disintegration of the tissues, in
order to render the cacao a fit and welcome article of food, not only
for healthy persons, but also for invalids and convalescent persons.</p>

<p>It was not until the Dutch cocoa thus manufactured had been intro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>duced
into England and Germany, where, as well as in Holland, it
became very popular, that manufacturers in Germany and Switzerland
began to devote their attention to the treatment with chemical
agents. The consumption of so-called “soluble” cocoa has increased
to such an extent of late years that it is now almost as large as that
of chocolate goods.</p>

<p>The term “soluble”, as now generally applied to cocoa powders,
is undoubtedly a misnomer, inasmuch as such preparations are
practically not soluble at all. We have therefore termed cocoa for
drinking purposes in this book “disintegrated” cacao, as the processes
described in the following pages only render the elements of cacao,
as, for instance, the cellulose, capable of suspension in liquids. It
would be quite impossible to render cacao, by any special treatment,
soluble in the real sense of the term, as is the case with salt or
sugar. It will thus be readily understood that the expression “disintegrated”
is correcter and more logical than the term “soluble
The degree to which disintegration has been carried, i. e. the efficiency
of the opening-up processes adopted, is marked by the absence of
any sediment worth speaking of in the beverage prepared with
boiling water, even after it has been left standing some time. The
greater the power of suspension of the preparation, the less particles
of cacao will settle to the bottom, and the higher the beverage will
be esteemed.</p>

<p>The disintegrating agents are, in practice, applied either to
the raw or roasted, but otherwise untreated beans, or to the more
or less defatted cacao, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">a) by treating the cacao with hot water, without or under
pressure;</p>

<p class="hang">b) by treatment with alkalis, such as carbonate of kali or
sodium, carbonate of magnesia (Dutch method), spirits of
ammonia (sal-ammoniac) and carbonate of ammonia (German
method).</p></blockquote>

<p>The chemical and physical effects brought about by these
agents consist chiefly in the swelling or steeping of the cellulose by
the action of the alkalis, as a consequence of which they sink less
rapidly in liquids than would be the case with untreated cacao. A
further effect is the partial neutralisation of the acids present, besides
which the cacao-red or pigment is also attacked, a result which may
be regarded as less desirable, as the cacao-red is the secreter of the
aroma, which naturally suffers with it. If the cacao is treated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
steam or hot water, the starch is apt to gelatinise, and the acids to
begin to ferment.</p>

<p>As the treatment with steam, for the reasons given above, is
nowadays rarely practised, we will at once proceed to consider the
method of disintegrating cacao most in use. Modifications of the
methods of manufacture bearing on this point will be dealt with in
their place under the corresponding heading later in this book.</p>


<h5>b. Methods of Disintegration.</h5>


<h6>1. <em class="gesperrt">Preliminary Treatment of the Beans.</em></h6>

<p>The method of manufacture of disintegrated cocoa comprises
the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) The cleaning and sorting of the raw bean;</li>
<li>b) Roasting;</li>
<li>c) Shelling, breaking and grinding;</li>
<li>d) Treatment with alkalis or water;</li>
<li>e) Expression of the fat or cacao butter;</li>
<li>f) Pulverising.</li>
</ul>

<p>The order of the above processes is subject under certain conditions
to various modifications arising from the fact that the alkalis
are applied at various stages in the course of manufacture, i. e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. before roasting;</li>
<li>II. during roasting;</li>
<li>III. after roasting,</li>
</ul>


<p>and further</p>

<ul>
<li>a) before pressing;</li>
<li>b) after pressing (treatment of the defatted beans).</li>
</ul>


<p>The cleaning and sorting of the raw beans, or, in short, the
complete treatment to which the raw cacao is subjected (a to c)
is in all methods effected by the same machines, a description of
which has been given on pages [Transcriber’s Note: Rest of line missing]</p>

<p>Some manufacturers proceed at once to treat the cacao with
alkali on completion of the above operations.</p>

<p>C. Stähle<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> effects the disintegration of cacao by subjecting
the beans to the chemical action of a mixture of ammonia and steam,
at a temperature not exceeding 100 Deg. C. The next process
(roasting) is then supposed to draw out the ammonia introduced into
the material, which, being volatile, easily escapes, and enables the
flavour to develop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>Pieper<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> moistens the raw beans with water, to which alkali
has been added, and this has the effect of neutralising the acids present
in the bean; afterwards the beans are fermented, dried and
roasted. The fermentation is described as rendering the particles of
albumin or protein bodies easily digestible and further imparts to
the beans a fine, reddish brown colour. This process is therefore
nothing but an after-fermentation of the cacao under the influence of
alkalis. From a scientific point of view, the process does not
possess the advantages which Pieper claims for it, with the exception
of the really evident improvement in colour. This effect can, however,
be obtained equally well by suitable treatment with water alone.</p>

<p>G. Wendt<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> has patented a method of improving the colour
and facilitating the disintegration of cacao, in which the beans are
treated, before roasting, with lime water and milk of lime (lime
solutions) and further washed with the solution during roasting.</p>

<p>We now turn to the methods of disintegration by means of
fixed alkalis (carbonate of magnesia, potash and sodium) first employed
by the Dutch, concerning which the following description will
be useful.</p>

<p>The cleaned beans are first very superficially roasted, to facilitate
winnowing, and the cacao thus treated (half roasted cacao) broken as
small as possible, which is an equally important factor in the shelling
and winnowing processes. It should be observed here that the less
the cacao has been roasted, the finer it should be broken. The
material is then impregnated by one of the above-mentioned alkaline
solutions, which is sprayed on to the beans. The chief agent employed
is potash (carbonate of potassium) in the proportion of 1½-2
(3 at the outside) parts of potash to 20-30 parts of water, for every
hundred parts of the defatted material to be treated. Some manufacturers
use sodium or a mixture of sodium and carbonate of
magnesia in place of the potash. As soon as the cacao has been
uniformly impregnated by the alkaline solution, the roasting process
should be completed. Still more care should be devoted to the
roasting of cacao for pulverising than is required in the case of
eating chocolates, as taste and smell play a more important part
and the point of complete roasting is not so easily recognised. The
cacao being roughly broken and the shells removed, the second
roasting process must of course be conducted over a low fire. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
most suitable machines for this purpose are the large roasting
machines illustrated on page 93, Fig. 14, as in these machines there
is little possibility of over-roasting, even when dealing with large
quantities and the machine is intensely heated; another advantage
is the easy accessibility of the roasting drum, which can be
immediately exposed by removing the front cover, for cleaning;
cleaning is very necessary in roasting machines. Broken and moistened
cacao chars much more readily than raw beans which have not
been deprived of their shells. If it is not possible to thoroughly
clean the interior of the roasting drum, as is often the case with
spherical roasters, the particles of cacao remaining in the drum continually
undergo re-roasting, finally falling in a completely charred
state into the cacao, thereby greatly prejudicing its taste.</p>

<p>If necessary, the cacao can now be passed through the breaking
machine again, from which it is transferred to the triple cacao mill,
which provides for fine grinding. The material is then deposited in
heated pans (see page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, Fig. 27) where it remains until ready for
the next process, the expression of the fat. The object of the fine
grinding in the mill is to render the cacao on being ground again after
the defatting process, easily capable of being sifted, and to obtain a
preparation which, on being mixed with hot water, leaves as little
sediment as possible.</p>


<h6>2. <em class="gesperrt">Expression of the Fat.</em></h6>

<p>Hydraulic presses are nowadays exclusively used for this
most important operation in the manufacture of “soluble” cocoa. The
methods of pressing have, in common with the other operations in
the course of manufacture, undergone considerable modification and
improvement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>According to Macquer (see Mitscherlich, S. 58) the butter was extracted
during the last century by pulverising the seeds, boiling them in water and
cleansing the fat, which, on cooling, congealed on the surface of the water, by
re-melting. According to Desprez (see Mitscherlich, S. 58), burned, shelled and
finely pulverised beans were spread to a height of 12-15 inches on coarse linen
or canvas, which was spanned across a vessel containing boiling water, to expose
the fine powder thoroughly to the action of the hot vapour. The powder
was then pressed, in linen bags, between two tin plates, whereby some 50% of
pure cacao butter was obtained. At a later period the heatable hydraulic pot-presses
came into use. The mass had, however, to be introduced into these pots
tied up in a cloth or sack, to facilitate which it was previously treated with water,
forming a thickish syrup very convenient for pressing. All these methods, however,
were attended with the great disadvantage that the cocoa, after being stored
some time, acquired a grey colour, or became mouldy. To avoid these un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>desirable
results presses were constructed which rendered it possible to liquefy
the mass without any further treatment in the receptacle in which the pressing
was conducted. Such a press, likewise acting hydraulically, is shown in Fig. 82
on the opposite page.</p></blockquote>

<p>This machine exerts a total pressure of 320000 kilogrammes
and works with 400 atmospheres. The construction of the machine
is similar to that of the well-known types of presses used by oil
manufacturers for the preparation of vegetable oils. When pressing,
however, the pots containing the cacao must be rendered water-tight
both at the top and bottom, to prevent the liquid cacao from escaping,
while such provision is not necessary in the case of the oil presses.
The stopping up of the press-pots is effected by means of a side-handle,
and arrangements are provided for heating the pots both
from above and below. The machine illustrated has 4 pots, arranged
one above the other, which can be drawn out on guide-rails towards
the front of the machine. During pressing, they close telescopically
with the piston arranged underneath each pot. The pump which
supplies the water for the hydraulic pressure, works perfectly automatically,
increases the pressure according to the quantity of fat
which has run off and keeps the pressure at its maximum or at any
degree required. With these presses it is possible to extract,
without difficulty, 85 % and even more of the total fat of the cacao
bean. If pressing is carried on at too high a temperature, a pale,
whitish grey butter is the result. If, however, a little attention is
paid by the operator at the press, the butter obtained is usually perfectly
clear, as it is first conducted through a horse-hair pad covered
with linen, or a camel-hair cushion 15 millimetres in thickness. Sufficient
attention is not always paid to the operation of pressing, so
that it often happens that some of the cacao escapes with the butter,
which is especially the case if the pressure has been increased too
rapidly at the beginning. If the butter is extracted for use in the
factory itself, the escape of the cacao with it is of no serious consequence;
if, however, the butter is intended for sale for commercial purposes,
its appearance is a most important factor, wherefore it is
advisable to filter the impure fat immediately after pressing. It is
true that, in most factories, the butter is in such cases merely remelted
to allow the impurities to settle to the bottom, this part being
then submitted again to the same treatment, while the rest of the
butter is disposed of on the market. If filtering is necessary, the
butter filter should be used, which, first constructed in Holland, has
been in use for a long time there. The principle of these filters is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
pass the butter through hanging tubes made of a filtering material
similar to flannel.</p>

<p>The firm of Volkmar Hänig &amp; Co. constructs special cocoa
butter filters which can be obtained through the firm of J. M. Lehmann.
Figs. 83 and 83a show this type of filter (cross and vertical
section), the manner of working with it being the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As soon as the butter has passed through the hair sieve in the upper part
of the apparatus, which removes larger objects such as pieces of wood etc., it
enters the hanging filter tubes, which, to facilitate cleaning, are interchangeable.
The filter butter accumulates in the large space provided for the purpose and is
withdrawn through a tap. An observing glass is attached to the apparatus for
the purpose of watching the height of the butter, and the whole filter is water-jacketed,
the water being heated by a steam coil fixed in the bottom of the
apparatus. A thermometer is fixed to the side of the filter, for regulating the
temperature.</p></blockquote>

<p>The degree to which cocoa powders should be defatted is an
important question which, some years ago, formed the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
much controversy. The relation between the percentage of fat contained
in the original cacao kernel, the expressed butter and the
defatted cacao mass is shown in tables 19 and 20.</p>

<p>The taste of defatted cacao is, as is well known, all the better
for being defatted to a low degree, and it is this which constitutes the
great advantage of cocoa prepared according to the Dutch method,
the remaining cacao content of which is some 24-33 percent, so
that, taking 50 percent as the average quantity of fat contained in
the cacao, only about 34-52 percent of the whole is removed from
the mass.</p>

<p>If the expression of the butter is carried to a further degree,
the cacao will certainly become more easily capable of suspension
in liquids<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>,
but such treatment is detrimental to its flavour<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">126</a>,
which is apt to become woody or bitter.
The statement, made by certain manufacturers and would-be connoisseurs,
that the bitter taste peculiar to the acid produced in cacao during
fermentation is the real aroma of the cacao, is undoubtedly erroneous.
It could, in the same way, be said of tea and its acids, the bitterer,
the better; which would of course end in the destruction of the true
flavour. Equally erroneous is the theory that bitter cacao is more
consistent. Such cacao must, previous to consumption, either be more
sweetened than usual or, if the same quantity of sugar is put in, less
of the beverage can be taken. When, for instance, very thin coffee
is made, the beans, on colouring an abnormally large quantity of
water, are said to be stronger, i. e. to yield more. The consistency
of all such beverages is, however, only a matter of taste, and it
would therefore be useless to discuss the subject in detail; some
persons prefer strong tea, which has been brewed a quarter of an hour,
others simply pour boiling water over the tea leaves and then drink
the beverage immediately. It may, however, safely be taken that the
highest amount of butter which can be expressed from cacao
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> without prejudicing
the flavour of the finished powder is 66 percent of the total fat
content. Manufacturers nowadays try as a rule to express as much
butter as possible, as the butter has a high price on the market, and
this tendency naturally has the effect of lowering the quality of the
cocoa. We thus come across cocoa powders containing only 20, 17, 15
percent of fat and even less. Of course nothing can be said against
the production of such cocoas, provided they are sold at a lower price
than cocoas more rich in fat and the public are aware that they are
purchasing a non-fatty preparation, besides which the expression of
so high a percentage of the fat alone rendered cocoa a fit regular
beverage for certain classes of invalids and persons suffering from
disorders of the stomach. The only serious drawback in this case is the
great variability of the fat content, which fluctuates between 13 and
35 percent. Such fluctuations are absolutely impossible in the case
of any other article of food which is manu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>factured and sold
wholesale, or, at any rate, buyers know in all such cases exactly what
they are purchasing; this is a point to which serious attention must be
called. It is very much to be regretted that the Association of German
Chocolate Makers<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
has declined to follow up this matter, while the Union of German Food Chemists,
after considerable controversy, advocated a distinct legal
classification of non-fatty cocoa powders containing up to 20 per
cent. of fat.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
We would prefer the Dutch preparations, which have remained the same up to the present
day, so-called fatty cocoas containing more than 25 percent of fat,
to be classified specially and those preparations which contain less
than this percentage of fat to be termed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_208">Pg 208</span> “highly defatted”
or “dry” cocoas, the names applied to both kinds being of little
importance as long as the public has the means of clearly recognising
the distinction (see tables <a href="#Page_203">19</a> and <a href="#Page_204">20</a>). Some 17 percent must be
taken as the minimum permissible butter value, which would mean
the expression of about 80 percent of the total fat content, or
two-thirds of the cacao mass itself; cocoa powders with only 15 per
cent. or less of butter are to be regarded as inferior in quality and
should not be produced. Unfortunately, however, these suggested limits
are, at any rate for the present, not likely to be realised.</p>

<p>The pressure obtained by means of the pressing devices above
described is naturally not sufficient for the production of such highly
defatted cocoas. Stronger presses are therefore necessary, one of
which, a very powerful apparatus, is shown in Fig. 84.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This machine, at the present time the most powerful cocoa butter press in
the world, brings a pressure of over one million kilos to bear on the cacao mass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
working with 400 atmospheres, and thus renders it possible to express as much
as 90 percent of the total fat content of the bean. The construction of this press
is exactly the same as that shown in Fig. 82, the pump Fig. 84a having, however,
three pistons or plungers instead of one; it works, like the other machine, automatically,
i. e., after the large quantity of water required at the commencement
has been fed into the press, the large plunger is put out of gear at a pressure
of 5 atmospheres; the two smaller pistons are then put into action together, and
produce the enormous pressure of 400 atmospheres.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85b.</div>
</div>

<p>After defatting, the expressed cacao cakes are allowed to cool
down, for which purpose they are transferred to flat trays or other
suitable receptacles, and pulverising and sifting the powder thus obtained
commenced.</p>


<h6>3. <em class="gesperrt">Pulverising and Sifting the Defatted Cacao.</em></h6>

<p>There are several methods of proceeding with these operations,
such as treating the expressed cacao in the melangeur already
described in an earlier part of this book (cf. 30-32 figs.) or passing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
through the centrifugal sifting machine (cf. 84b and 88 figs.) with which
we are now acquainted. At a time when the melangeur was to a certain
extent the universal machine of the manufacturer, it was almost exclusively
utilised for pulverisation, that up-to-date division of labour whereby
this machine is limited to mixing (and very properly so limited, as
its name implies) and the preparation of cacao powders on the contrary
assigned to more efficient constructions having then not as yet
been adopted. We annex a description of one or two specially constructed
arrangements for the pulverisation and sifting of cacao, as
manufactured by J. M. Lehmann and already repeatedly tested.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_210.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 86.</div>
</div>

<p>First there is the cacao cake crusher (figs. 85a and 85b), which
reduces the pressed cake into rather large pieces about the size of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
walnut, previous to its being pulverised either in the melangeur, centrifugal
sifting machine or some similar apparatus. It has been furnished
with one (fig. 85a) and in some cases even with two (fig. 85b)
pair of toothed or cogged rollers, and the cacao in this latter type of
construction is crushed as small as a pea, which reduction, although
it is by no means essential, considerably relieves the strain on the
pulverising machine and is also in some sort a protection against
unnecessary waste of material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 87.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>
<p>Then again, there is the so-called pulveriser shown in fig. 86.
This is in principle an edge-mill with revolving bed-stone and runners,
both made of granite. The coarsely broken press cakes are fed into
the mill through a hopper provided with a slide, and are reduced to
a loose powder of firmly fixed colour, escape of dust being prevented
by the hood fitted to the mill. By turning a crank, a lateral sliding
door is opened, and an arrangement inside is set in motion, by which
the ground cacao is turned out of the mill. The pressure of the runners
can be diminished and even completely nullified.</p>

<p>For cacao that has been thoroughly defatted (“dry” cocoa),
the hardness of which demands a more efficient treatment than is
possible in these machines, they being only calculated to press or at
the most exert a rubbing effect, there are the crushers proper, called
mills built in pulverising plants for dry cocoas as illustrated on
fig. 87.</p>

<p>The pressed cacao, already broken up to some extent in a
preliminary crusher (cf. figs. 85a and b), is systematically conducted
through the mill by an elevator provided with hopper and feeding
apparatus. On the interior of the machine, which is completely
plated with steel-plates, there is a cross-arm as on a windmill, which
passes through a large number of revolutions per minute. Chiefly
owing to its thrashing effect, the cacao in the mill is fine ground,
without any rubbing or exertion of pressure as in the melangeur and
other machines. The outer part of the frame consists of a grating
with various widths of hole, which can be readily changed. The
whole of the powder which has attained a certain degree of fineness
falls through these meshes and is so despatched from the machine
at once, an additional advantage when comparing this mill with the
melangeur, in which all the powder, even that sufficiently ground,
must remain till the final discharging, much to the detriment of its
flavour and aroma.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_213.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 88.</div>
</div>

<p>The powdered cacao next succeeds to the sifting operations,
after it has first cooled a little, and for these the centrifugal sifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
machines are used in the main. Special care must be taken that such
apparatus as is used is not too diminutive to deal with the quantities
of cacao introduced, as this is extremely injurious to the machine. It
is further to be noted that no type of sifter whatever can yield good
results if it has not been especially constructed for dry cacaos.</p>

<p>We have before us in fig. 88 centrifugal sifting machine constructed
on one of the largest scales. In this cacao is introduced in
the floor of the sieve through a feeder, and by means of an elevator.
The sifting cylinder is spanned with silk or bronze gauze, and conceals
in its interior a rough sort of preliminary sieve, the purpose of
which is to prevent the larger unpowdered pieces penetrating to the
silk gauze. There is a ventilator inside this rough sieve, which produces
and transmits an air current, so that the meshes are kept open.
Under proper guidance it is practically impossible for the machine
to break down, although the sieve must be cleansed twice daily, an
operation scarcely requiring more than two or three minutes, as it is
not necessary first to remove the part under consideration. Because
of this easy manner of cleaning, the centrifugal sifter far excels all
others, as the plan sifter, the latter generally having to be dismounted
before this operation can be proceeded with.</p>

<p>The powder issues from the first outlet of the sieve. There is
a second, where both preliminary and cylinder sieve transmit their
overflow, and this is then again conducted to the pulveriser in order
to be worked up once more. Pulverisers and sifting apparatus can be
so combined by means of conveyors and elevators that they work automatically,
which is always of immense advantage where a large daily
output is in question. But pressed cakes which are to be conducted
through the machine in broken pieces must first be treated in a preliminary
crusher (cf. figs. 85a and b).</p>

<p>Fig. 88a shows one of the plansieves of the firm Baumeister,
and protected by patent, which also finds employment for the sieving
of cacao powder.</p>

<p>This machine possesses four round sieves lying one upon
another, on which the material to be sieved is moved by a crank driving
power just as on a hand sieve, so that the surface of the sieve
is fully employed. The sieves possess neither projection nor hauling
gear, the sieving is effected without pressure or friction, and the
powder is therefore loose and woolly. A brushing arrangement revolves
without any mechanism, driven solely by the peculiar movement
of the plansieve, under the wholly flat sieves, and this brushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
arrangement any cacao powder which may adhere to the sieve and
so prevents a displacement of the tension, as far as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 89.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>
<p>In the following illustration we give as an example the arrangement
of a pulverising plant with pulverisers (cf. fig. 86) for a
second time.</p>

<p>The preliminary crusher receives the cakes, and then a conveyor
brings the broken pieces along to the elevator, which in its turn
feeds the filling box of the pulveriser, the connection between the
two being established by a sliding platform. The discharged material
succeeds on a landing where it is cooled down a little. A second
conveyor brings it to the elevator of the sifting machine. Whilst the
fine powder is taken up in barrels collectively introduced under the
apparatus, the remainder of the cacao passes along to the conveyor
first mentioned, is mixed with other broken pieces of cacao cake, and
so returns to the pulveriser.</p>

<p>In reference to the Dutch method of disintegration, mention
must be made of the process adopted by Moser &amp; Co. in Stuttgart<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>,
where the cleansed, shelled and moistened beans are enclosed in a
rotating drum, so that they can be subjected to the influence of
ammonia and water vapour, produced from a solution of ammonium
carbonate, which is passed through the hollow interior of the drum.
The beans are then roasted and so freed of superfluous ammonia,
after which follow in regular order the processes of grinding, defatting
and pulverising.</p>

<p>After this description of the Dutch and other well-known
methods of disintegration obtaining in the manufacture of cocoa
powder, we shall now proceed to describe such of the remaining processes
as seem to deserve mention.</p>


<h5>c. Disintegration after Roasting.</h5>

<p>The chief difference between the following methods of procedure
and the Dutch and other processes previously referred to is
that in the former the beans are neither impregnated with alkalis
before nor during the roasting, but after it has been carried out, and
the impregnation occurs sometimes prior, and at other times subsequent,
to the expression of the fat. The several stages of treatment
which proceed this process succeed each other in the same order as
in the preparation of chocolate, cleansing, sorting, roasting, crushing,
shelling and trituration following one after the other. But if the treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>ment
with alkali is to take place before the fat is expressed, the
cacao passes from the grinding mill direct to the apparatus in which
it is subjected to the action of a solution of potash or some other
alkali.</p>


<h6>1. <em class="gesperrt">Disintegration prior to Pressing.</em></h6>

<p>The system of impregnating the ground but as yet undefatted
beans with alkali was first introduced into Germany by Otto Rüger,
Lockwitzgrund. The principle features of the Rüger process are
similar to those of other methods at present frequently met with, so
that a detailed description would seem to be rather superfluous.
Melangeurs may be conveniently employed in the treatment of cacao
mass in a liquid state with alkalis, such as we have previously described,
and illustrated in fig. 86 on page 210.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_217.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 90 a.</div>
</div>

<p>As preparing machines for disintegration, the kneading and
mixing apparatus shown in working position in fig. 28, page 118, and
in fig. 90 a with tilted trough for emptying are specially constructed
and patented and quite deserve the popularity they have acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 91 a.</div>
</div>

<p>Their construction and method of working are described on page 118.
Other well-known machines for the purpose are the “Universal”
mixing and kneading machines patented by Werner &amp; Pfleiderer,
which are shown in figs. 90 b and 90 c. As regards the general outlines
of their construction, it will suffice to refer to the excellent de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>scriptions
of the machines which occur in the catalogues issued by
this firm. Mention cannot fail to be made, however, of the circumstance
that in these machines the evaporation of the alkaline solvent
is also effected. The working of the kneading arms facilitates the
escape of vapour from the mass and prevents overheating from contact
with the walls of the apparatus. Underneath, the trough is provided
with a double jacket, that is heated by steam.</p>

<p>To maintain connection of the steam and water pipes whilst
the trough is reversed there are two flexible metal tubes. Both are
screwed to the fixed pipes. For carrying away the vapour given off
there is a tin plate cover to the trough, provided with a charging
aperture and a channel inside to catch the moisture collecting on
the cover and discharge it. When the machine is to be emptied, the
cover is raised and a receiver adapted to the size and form of the machine
is so placed that the charge can be diverted into it. The tilting
of the machine is effected mechanically, and depends on the working
of a lever. So as to prevent spurting of the liquid material when
discharging, the stirring arms can be stopped for a time.</p>

<p>From this “Universal” Kneader and Mixer the special type
“Vacuum Kneader”, system Werner-Pfleiderer, is distinguished, as its
name implies, by a vacuum arrangement. As seen on illustrations 91 a
and b, this comprises a pyramid-like cover made of cast iron, and
shutting down air-tight, which is provided with indiarubber caulking,
and binding screws, and is fitted up for steam heating. It moves on
the frame of the machine and is counterpoised with weights, so as
to facilitate its raising and lowering. On the front part of the lid
there is a small aperture paned in with glass, and opposite on the
interior in a specially protected compartment occurs an electric light
arrangement, which admits of the continual observation of the material
during the working up processes. In addition, small quantities of
cacao mass can be introduced on removal of the glass pane without
lifting up the lid; so that the advantages of the aperture are twofold.
The upper part of the cover tapers off into a suction pipe, which
itself terminates in a flanged support intended as a finish to the conduit
from the airpump.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_221.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 91 b.</div>
</div>

<p>The kneading trough of the machine is made of cast iron, provided
with a false bottom, and fitted up for heating with hot water or
steam to a pressure of 7 atmospheres, or for cooling down with cold
water. By way of rapid discharging, the trough is counterpoised
with weights, and can easily be tilted over by means of a hand winch.
Its interior, as also the kneading shovels, are clean scoured, and the
bearings of the shovels stopped with easily adjustable stuffing boxes.
These stuffing boxes (German Patent) are so fitted in that no greasing
substances whatever can penetrate to the cacao mass, which is of the
highest importance, as in the case of the ordinary stuffing boxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
grease is sucked up into the kneading trough by the action of the air
pumps and the material contained in this so rendered impure. The
steam and water conduit to and fro is effected by means of supple
metallic hose, which follow the movement of the trough as it is tilted.</p>

<p>The vacuum kneading machines have acquired great importance
in the manufacture of milk chocolates, where it is chiefly a
question of reducing mixtures of cacao, sugar, and condensed milk
to a requisite thickness. Lately the value of the machine has been
regarded as consisting in the main of the possibility of preparing cacao
under vacuum which it affords.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that the treatment of the cacao under
vacuum demands a much lower temperature and takes place in about
half the time requisite for open machines, where it must be carried
out against the constant and contrary influence of the atmosphere,
apart from the fact that the vacuum kneader preserves the aroma far
better.</p>

<p>The alkali solution used in disintegration may be prepared in
vats fitted with draw-off cocks, or, in small factories, in glass carboys
such as are used for the conveyance of acids. Of the fixed
alkalis, potash is preferable, since it is a natural constituent of terrestrial
plants and therefore of the cacao bean, and so its employment
introduces no foreign ingredient. Magnesium carbonate seems to
find favour in many quarters, but we consider it less suitable as being
insoluble in water, and therefore can only be incorporated with the
cacao mass in a state of suspension. It is sufficient to have a potash
solution some 90 or 95 % strong, answering to the requirements of
modern medical treatises.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The salt is soluble in an equal quantity
of water.</p>

<p>In preparing the solution, the best plan is to dissolve a known
quantity in from 3 to 4 times as much water at the temperature of
the room and then by diluting with water reduce this composition to
the required strength. As for each 100 kilos of cacao still undefatted
from 2 to at the most 3 kilos of potash and from 15 to 20 kilos of water
are required, this 2 or 3 kilos of the salt should be dissolved in about
10 litres of water and the solution after diluted with the remainder of
the water.</p>

<p>In using volatile alkalis, which are nevertheless falling into
disuse more and apparently no longer maintain their reputation, ordi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>nary
ammonium carbonate which may be easily obtained in powder
form at any chemist’s, or a solution of ammonia, such as spirits of
sal-ammoniac, may be used. The former is easily soluble in about
five parts of water. From ½ to 3 kilograms of ammonium carbonate
are generally reckoned for every 100 kilos of undefatted cacao material,
and this amount is dissolved in water, the whole of the salt being
at once introduced into from 15 to 30 litres, as when smaller quantities
are used there ensues a decomposition of the salt and one of the
products of decomposition, the carbonate of ammonium, remains
undissolved.</p>

<p>The spirits of sal-ammoniac operate much more effectively than
the ammonium carbonate on account of their high percentage of
ammonia, and so only a third as much of this substance may be
employed, and generally even smaller quantities prove quite sufficient.
Consequently 100 kilos of defatted cacao should be mixed with
0·5-1 kilo of ammonia solution (specific gravity 0·96), previously
diluted with 20 or at the most 29 litres of water. The mixture should
be prepared in glass carboys immediately before use, because of the
volatility of ammonia.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the cacao, salt solution and cacao are together
introduced into a melangeur, or better into the kneading and
mixing machine, and the apparatus being set in working order, steam
enters, and removes the quantities of water which have been added,
as well as the volatile alkalis. Whether all the water has been driven
off or no can only be judged from the consistency of the mass after
treatment, and it is just this that renders the process of little value.
The cacao material issuing from the machine must be just as liquid as
when it comes out of the triturating mills, and so long as it appears
as a glucose substance, which very often happens where unsuitable
mixing machines are employed, so surely will it contain water, and
this may lead to the growth of mould or to the cacao developing a
grey colour when packed in boxes. If the cacao cannot be sufficiently
dried in these machines, it must be transferred to some sort of drying
plant (where the temperature is about 48 ° C.), and there deprived of
its still remaining moisture.</p>

<p>When volatile alkali is used, kneading and mixing machines
cannot very well be dispensed with, as they work up the cacao
material much more thoroughly and admit of a better distribution of
the ammonia than the melangeur or incorporator. In this case it is
advisable that the entire process be carried out in some apartment
separated from the other rooms of the factory, in order that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
pungent smell of ammonia may not be communicated to other products,
a further evil connected with this method of disintegration. At the
same time provision must be made for the escape of the discharged
gas through flues leading out into the open air.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>The treated cacao, when perfectly free from water and volatile
alkali, then passes on to the press, pulveriser and sifting machine
successively, the several operations being proceeded with exactly as
described. In the original process of Rüger’s, the defatted and disintegrated
cacao is dried after it has been reduced to smaller pieces,
and then mixed with fat in such proportions as seem requisite and
desirable, so that it is possible in this method to re-imbue a disintegrated
cacao with its original percentage of fatty contents.</p>


<h6>2. <em class="gesperrt">Disintegration after Pressing.</em></h6>

<p>In this process, which may no longer be adopted as far as we
can ascertain the mechanically prepared beans are roasted, crushed
and decorticated, then ground in mills, defatted, and finally the cakes
are broken up into a rough powder and treated with alkali in the
manner above described. Care must here be taken to use as little
water as possible in dissolving the alkali. It is best to employ potash
exclusively, for it has been found that the last traces of volatile alkali
are extremely difficult to remove from defatted cacaos as decomposed
by the solution, and there is no means of neutralising the ammonia
without at the same time causing material damage to the flavour and
aroma of the product treated.</p>

<p>The concentrated solution of alkali may be conveniently
sprayed on the powder while the latter is subjected to a constant
stirring, an operation best effected in the melangeur. The final drying
is carried out in hot closets, provided with an effective ventilator
suitable to the purpose. After it has been thoroughly dried, the cacao
next succeeds to the pulverising and sifting processes.</p>

<p>Some methods of rendering cacao soluble remain to be mentioned,
wherein no alkali whatever is used, and in which the disintegration
is effected by means of either water or steam. The first process
of the kind was invented by Lobeck &amp; Co of Dresden<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> in the
year 1883. The cacao beans, either raw, roasted, decorticated, ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
or otherwise mechanically treated are exposed to heat and the action
of steam under high pressure in a closed vessel, then subsequently
powdered and dried. The process has little to recommend it and has
not been able to establish itself accordingly, for hereby the starch in
the cacao is gelatinised, and acid fermentation is introduced, such as
does not fail to damage the final product. Then again, there is a
danger of the cacao becoming mouldy in the store rooms, after being
treated by this process.</p>

<p>A second method, patented by Gädke, German Patent
No. 93 394, 17 th. Jan. 1895, consists in disintegrating by means
of water in a less practical manner. The roasted, decorticated
but as yet unground beans are moistened with water, and
subsequently dried at a temperature of 100 ° C. after which
succeed the processes of grinding, defatting, pulverising and so forth.
This process has also failed to establish itself to any effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our opinion any one of these methods skilfully and properly
carried out will yield a marketable, hygienic and wholesome product,
though some of them can boast of their own particular advantages.
This holds good for the so-called “Dutch” method in particular, though
it is open to the objection that the cacao so prepared is combined with
an extraneous product and that the combination remains right up to
the moment of consumption. Considered from this point of view,
disintegration with fixed alkalis is generally less advisable than the
optional treatment with water or volatile alkali, but it may be taken
for granted that each manufacturer had better decide the several details
best adapted to his own particular outfit.</p>

<p>A well made soluble cocoa powder should have a pure brown
colour, without any suspicion of grey, should be perfectly dry, and
feel light and soft when finely divided, so betraying that property
which the French designate under the term “impalpable The
peculiar aroma of the cacao must be retained, and especially should
the preparation be preserved from the slightest taint of any ammonia
combination, its taste being kept pure and cacao-like, any hint of
alkalinity indicating defect in the manner of disintegration. Over and
above delicacy of aroma and taste, that characteristic described as
“solubility” constitutes a main criterion of quality in the eyes of the
consuming public. To ascertain that only an empirical test can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
employed.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> About 7·5 grammes of cocoa powder are introduced into
some 150 grammes of hot milk or hot water contained in a graduated
beaker, and then the quantity of sediment which sinks to the bottom
of the vessel in a given time is noted. The more slowly a sediment is
formed and the smaller it is, the greater the “solubility” of the cocoa.</p>

<p>If it becomes necessary to give the cacao an additional flavouring,
the spices or ether-oils generally employed in the manufacture
of chocolate may be used in the course of pulverisation, and
shortly before sifting.</p>

<h3><a name="C_Packing_and_Storing_of_the_finished_Cacao" id="C_Packing_and_Storing_of_the_finished_Cacao">C. Packing and Storing of the finished Cacao
Preparations.</a></h3>


<p>Chocolate will keep in its original condition for years, when
protected from atmospheric influence. It is therefore generally, and
especially where the finer qualities are concerned, packed up immediately
after it leaves the last process, and ornamented chocolates
are previously varnished with an alcoholic solution of benzoin and
shellac (see page <a href="#Page_250">250</a>).</p>

<p>The inferior qualities are usually packed in paper and wooden
boxes, but the superior first in tin-foil and subsequently in paper.
<em class="gesperrt">Cocoa powder</em> arrives packed in parchment boxes as a rule, and
also in cardboard or tin boxes.</p>

<p>Although packing in parchment or waxed paper is hygienically
and economically more advantageous than tin-foil packing, the latter
is nevertheless to be preferred, not only because it is a better preservative
of the aroma evident in the spices added, but also because
it prevents an evil which also in the end leaves its mark on cacao,
when stored a very long time, to wit, the development of rancidity.
This is explained by the fact that the tin-foil sticks to the chocolate,
and so hinders the penetration of air.</p>

<p>According to an act dating from June 25th. 1897, and in force
in Germany (Reichsgesetzblatt No. 22), metal-foil containing more
than one percent of lead may not be used in the packing of snuff,
chewing tobacco and cheese. What holds good for other articles of
consumption must also apply to cacao preparations, when they are
so packed that they come first of all into contact with metal-foil, and
not with paper. Tin-plating also, containing in its coating more than
1 % of lead and in the soldering more than 10 % is also inadmissible in
the chocolate industry. Although it is said that the whole of the
tin-plate fittings made in Germany are constructed according to an
imperial standard, yet it may occasionally so happen that cheap
packing material does not correspond and answer to the legal
requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>The manufacturer can only protect himself against possible
prosecution for contravening or neglecting the articles of this act by
obtaining a written guarantee as to the quality of the tin-plate supplied.</p>

<p>The rooms where chocolate wares are stored should not be
too warm, and it is indispensable that they be kept dry, for heat
accelerates the volatilisation of their aroma and also the rancidity to
which cacao is liable, whilst moisture spoils the general appearance
of the chocolate and promotes the growth of mould. This
development of mould, which is first noticeable after long storage in
damp, dark warehouses, is principally due to the growth of a fungus
which Royer has named “Cacao-oïdium<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>As the numerous wrappings (in tin-foil, paper, etc.) are at present
only effected by hand labour, they mean an appreciable increase
in the price of the goods. This is of less moment for the chocolate
tablets as the small napolitains and the like. Therefore attempts
have often been made to effect this wrapping by means of machines<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>,
and I have seen among others two models for napolitains, one on a
large and the other on a small scale, the property of a Hamburg chocolate
factory, and constructed by the firm of A. Savy &amp; Co., Paris, which
same machines were said to effect the wrapping in tin-foil, folding and
additional packing in paper, as also the final closing, automatically
and well; but just as I requested to be shown the machines, I was
told that they were for the time being not in working order. Since
then I have heard no more of the matter, and regret that the firm of
Savy &amp; Co., who have a branch in Dresden, have not been able to
answer several letters which I sent them inquiring for further
particulars. It must be that the machines have failed to answer their
purpose, for otherwise they would have been assured of a hearty
reception, no matter how dear they might have been. So for
the nonce our chocolate packing must depend on hand labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>Quite a different arrangement obtains in respect to cocoa
powder, which was also originally packed up in paper bags by hand.
This operation is to-day despatched in machines, as also in the case
of other powder substances, like tooth-powder, dyes, patent foods,
soap powder, etc., and this even in the smallest of factories. It is true
that the machine built a decade ago by L. Wagner in Heilbronn and
at that time described by Zipperer in our second edition, which was
to wrap up a dozen packets simultaneously, seems to have failed,
for it is no longer constructed; yet its place has been taken by a
succession of other machines which have stood the tests of many
years. The principle has been altered, many packets at one time
not being filled, but always one only, and the advantage lies in the
fact that the machine fills more exactly and with a higher degree of
uniformity as regards the weights of the several packets.</p>

here be made of the firm of Fritz Kilian, whose automatic filler and
packer “Ideal” (fig. 92) for quantities of from 25-2500 grammes, and

Ingredients used in the manufacture
of chocolate.</h2>


<h3 id="A_Legal_enactments_Condemned_ingredients">A. Legal enactments. Condemned ingredients.</h3>


<p>Chocolate is a mixture of cacao mass with sugar, to which
usually spices and even cacao butter are also added. The sugar
generally amounts to rather more than one half (60 percent) of the
total mixture. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla, cloves, nutmeg,
mace, cardamoms, as well as cacao butter, or perfumes like peruvian
balsam, are only added in small quantity so as to improve or alter
the flavour as required. Recently, the ethereal oils of the spices have
been used for this purpose as well as artificially prepared aromatic
substances, such as vanillin, for example. Flour and starch<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>, although
the latter is seldom used, are permissible ingredients in cheaper
kinds of chocolate but only when the fact of the addition is plainly
stated. The kinds of flour usually employed are wheat and potato
flours, rice-starch and arrowroot, dextrin and, less frequently, oat,
barley, acorn, chestnut, or rye flour. In certain forms of dietetic
chocolate, sugar being injurious to invalids, it is replaced by saccharin;
another material, such as a leguminous flour from beans, peas
or lentils, must be employed in its place.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> In some kinds of fancy
chocolate, harmless colours, tincture of benzoin etc. are used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>


<h3>B. Ingredients allowed</h3>


<h4>I. Sweet Stuffs.</h4>


<h5>a) Sugar.</h5>

<p>Both cane and beetroot sugar are employed in the manufacture
of chocolate. As this naturally possesses a brownish colour, brownish
white as well as white sugar is used for mixing with the cacao mass.
The kinds of sugar used are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">1. Sugar dust, a white crystallisable and very fine powder.</p>

<p class="hang">2. Crystal or granulated sugar, consisting of loose, plain
crystals, and suitable for almost all purposes in the manufacture.</p>

<p class="hang">3. Sugar flour I, II, and III which is a difficultly crystallisable
sugar containing an amount of molasses increasing with the
number, and it is of a more or less brown colour.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 94.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>The chocolate manufacturer nevertheless requires the sugar to
answer to certain characters. It must dissolve in half its weight of
warm water forming a sweet syrup. The syrup must have no action
on either red or brown litmus paper i. e. have neither acid nor alkaline
reaction, and on no account coagulate boiling milk.</p>

<p>The sugar is usually added to the cacao mass in the form of
a very fine powder and sometimes in a coarser condition, though that
is not to be recommended. By using finely powdered sugar, the rolling
of the cacao mass is considerably facilitated and the manufacture
is accelerated. The sugar must be perfectly dry, as damp sugar
yields a dull chocolate which readily crumbles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 95.</div>
</div>

<p>For grinding the sugar, the so called edge-runner mill as shown
in figure 94 was formerly employed.</p>

<p>It is like the melangeur constructed of a firmly fixed bed-stone
and two cylindrical runners.</p>

<p>The pulverised material issuing from such an apparatus must
then be passed through one of the various kinds of sifting
machines, where the finer parts fall through the meshes of a silken
sieve, whilst the rougher are discharged at the end of the arrangement:
for small factories such machines as the drum sifters illustrated
in fig. 95, and for the larger those centrifugal sifters which have
already been fully described.</p>

<p>The constructions for grinding have of late been considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
perfected. The most practical arrangements for pulverising all kinds
of granulated sugar and so-called lump sugar, are those combined
grinding and sifting installations such as are executed by the firm of
J. M. Lehmann in Dresden. The grinding is here effected by disintegrators
(revolving arms, etc.) similar to those used in the pulverising
of cocoa powder as described on page 212. The output of these disintegrators<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
is extraordinarily large, and the harder and drier the ground
sugar is, the finer the pulverised material resulting. We annex a
diagram of the machine in fig. 96.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 96.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>The granulated or lump sugar is filled into the hopper and
thence lead along a conveyor to be ground in another part of the
machine, and can be controlled as regards quantity. The blades,
which pass through about 3000 revolutions a minute, seize the sugar
and swing it against the ribbed walls of the mantle, after which it
falls in smaller fragments on a grater fitted in the under part of the
apparatus. The sugar which passes through the grating is now conducted
by conveyor and elevator to the sifting arrangement, whilst
the rougher material is again whirled round by the blades. This
sifting arrangement consists of a cylindrical sieve, on the interior of
which there occur revolving arms which provide for the despatch of
material through the various sieves. The rougher stuff which remains
is removed by hand or some other mechanical means and transported
to the hopper once more. A chamber placed above the machine and
connected with the grinding apparatus by means of pipes provides
for the protection of the machine against dust.</p>

<p>Such installations are constructed in various sizes and fashions,
and possess immense outputs (up to even 5000 kilogrammes daily).
That they must be built in special shops is clear from the fact that
so large a quantity of dusty sugar sacks need transporting after the
processes are completed. It is further to be noted that the fineness of
the sugar corresponds to the mesh-work of the sieves, which as we
have previously stated, can be chosen with any size of hole desired,
yet this naturally influences the machine, and recently a very high
standard of fineness has been generally dropped, and rougher siftings
are now made, as when the sugar is too fine.—e. g. in the case of the
cheaper qualities—it absorbs too much of the fatty contents, and so
necessitates the addition of cacao butter, whilst on the other hand,
when the chocolate is of a finer quality, the sugar is sufficiently
reduced in the trituration to which the mixed material is subjected.</p>


<h5>b) Saccharin and other sweetening agents.</h5>

<p>Apart from the sugar, which is such an important factor in
the chocolate manufacture, mention must also be made of another
sweetening material, formerly frequently used as a substitute for
sugar, but now only to be obtained at the apothecary’s on exhibition
of a medical order, in consequence of certain legal restrictions which
have recently come in force. It is called Fahlberg saccharin, and
again zuckerin, sykorin, crystallose, “Süßstoss Höchst” and sykose.</p>

<p>Saccharin is not like sugar a carbohydrate naturally produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
by plants, but a derivative of the aromatic compounds which the
chemist has artificially constructed from the products of the distillation
of coal.</p>

<p>Saccharin is benzoyl-sulphonimide, and it has the chemical
formula</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td class="r" rowspan="2">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub><span class="brace2">≺</span></td>
  <td>CO</td>
  <td class="l" rowspan="2"><span class="brace2">≻</span>NH</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>SO<sub>2</sub></td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>It is a white, crystalline powder, so exceedingly sweet
that its taste can be perceived in a dilution of 1 in 70000. It
is only slightly soluble in cold water (1: 400) but more easily so in
hot water (1: 28). The material known as easily soluble saccharin
is its sodium salt. It contains 90 percent of saccharin and is the most
easily digested compound of saccharin.</p>

<p>For technical, domestic and medicinal purposes the soluble
saccharin which is only from 300-450 times as sweet as sugar is
employed. Besides being unfermentable saccharin has very slight
antiseptic properties; according to L. Nencki<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> the digestibility of
albumin is less affected by it, in the proportion usually added to
articles of food, than by Rhine wine, or by a sugar solution of equal
sweetness. Saccharin is entirely unaltered in the human organism,
hence it forms a welcome sweetening material for invalids suffering
from diabetes, corpulence or diseases of the stomach to whom
ordinary sugar is injurious. The substances known as dulcin and
glucin are analogous to saccharin in sweetening property, the first
being phenetol-carbamid and the latter a monosulphonate of amido-triazine.</p>

<p>The latest substance of this class is termed “sucramin” and
consists of the ammonium salt of saccharin. It is readily soluble
in water, less so in alcohol and is 700 times sweeter than sugar. It
can be obtained either in the pure form or mixed (20 percent) with
sugar.</p>

<p>In chocolate making, saccharin is at present of little importance,
owing to the relatively small volume required as compared with
sugar. Recently it has again been recommended to the extent of
0·76 percent as a sweetening material for cocoa powder. It would
certainly be of value in cocoa powders to be consumed by invalids
and persons not able to take sugar, although it will never come into
general use. The detection of saccharin has acquired increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
importance in Germany since the passing of the acts of October
1st 1898 and July 7th 1902, regulating the trade in artificial sweetening
materials. According to Zipperer’s experiments, it may be detected in
the following manner: A mixture of 5 grammes of the finely powdered
substance with 100 ccm of water is allowed to stand for 2 hours,
occasionally stirred and afterwards filtered. The filtrate is acidulated
with three drops of hydrochloric acid and evaporated to 20 ccm, then
shaken<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> with 50 ccm of ether in a separator and left standing for a
day to separate into two layers. The ether solution is separated and
evaporated to dryness in a beaker, the residue being mixed with
0·1 gramme of resorcin and 4-5 drops of concentrated sulphuric
acid<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> (Börnsteins test). The mixture is then heated over a small
Bunsen flame and the melted material saturated with normal sodium
hydrate. The appearance of a strong fluorescence indicates the presence
of saccharin. Saccharin can also be easily recognised by the
sweet taste of the ether residue.</p>


<h4>II. Kinds of Starch, Flour.</h4>

<p>The chief kinds of starch used in chocolate making are rice
starch, arrowroot, potato starch and wheat starch, occasionally also
small quantities of dextrine.</p>


<h5>1. <em class="gesperrt">Potato starch or flour.</em></h5>

<p>Potato starch is a white or faintly yellowish powder in which
single, glistening granules can be seen by the naked eye. Under
the microscope the granules appear mostly single with evident
striae, usually with pointed ends containing the nucleus; they are also
eccentric in structure. This starch rarely contains fragments of tissue.
It is prepared by first treating finely divided pared potatoes with
1 percent dilute sulphuric acid, then washing, drying and grinding
the starch.</p>


<h5>2. <em class="gesperrt">Wheat starch.</em></h5>

<p>Wheat starch can be obtained either from crushed wheat or
from wheaten flour by treatment with water after the nitrogenous
constituent, gluten, has been separated by kneading. It amounts to
about 60-70 percent of the grain. Under the microscope the granules
appear to differ considerably in size. They are distinguished from
potato starch by the nearly central hilum, surrounded by faintly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
marked concentric striae, and again by the granules being more
frequently adherent. Wheat flour rather than the starch is generally
used in chocolate making.</p>


<h5>3. <em class="gesperrt">Dextrin.</em></h5>

<p>When starch is heated to between 200° and 210° C. it is converted
chiefly into dextrin or starch gum with a little sugar. Dextrin
is a white to yellowish and tasteless powder with a peculiar smell;
it differs from starch in being readily soluble in water. It gives a
reddish colour with an aqueous solution of iodine. Fehling’s solution
is unaffected by dextrin in the cold, but on long continued heating it is
reduced to red cuprous oxide.</p>


<h5>4. <em class="gesperrt">Rice starch.</em></h5>

<p>Rice starch is obtained from inferior kinds of rice and from
rice waste by treatment with water. It appears under the microscope
as small granules or oval bodies of various sizes. According to their
position the granules always seem to be polygons,<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> formed by
coalescence. It is thus easily distinguished from the previously
mentioned starches.</p>


<h5>5. <em class="gesperrt">Arrowroot.</em></h5>

<p>Several kinds of starch, obtained from the tubers of various
species of plants are commercially known under this name.</p>

<p>1. West Indian arrowroot, from Maranta arundinacea, is a fine
and almost white powder. Under the microscope it always appears
to consist of pear or spindle-shaped granules with eccentric hilum.</p>

<p>2. East Indian arrowroot is obtained from various species of
ginger plants. It is a fine white powder and is seen under the microscope
as single granules with well marked eccentric hilum and closely
stratified at the spindle-shaped ends. It much resembles Guiana
arrowroot, which is obtained from varieties of Yam.</p>

<p>3. Queensland arrowroots from species of Cycas and Canna,
appear as flat, coarse and mostly single granules. They can be
easily distinguished from other kinds of starch by the large size of
the granules.</p>

<p>4. Brazil arrowroot, from the Manihot plants which belong to
the order of Euphorbiaceae. Under the microscope the granules
appear compound, the parts being of a drum or sugar loaf shape with
many concentric striae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>


<h5>6. <em class="gesperrt">Chestnut meal.</em></h5>

<p>Chestnut or maron meal also comes under consideration in
the chocolate industry. The appearance of the starch granules is
most characteristic. They are partly single and partly composed
of two individual granules. The single granules, according to J. F.
Hanausek<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>, appear in such a variety of forms as to defy a summarised
description. Frequently they occur oval, spindle, club, or flat kidney
shaped, resembling those of the leguminous family; but especially to
be noticed is the triangular contour of some granules, as well as
some with projecting points. The central nucleus and its cavity are
generally distinct, but the stratification is very slight or quite
unrecognisable.</p>


<h5>7. <em class="gesperrt">Bean meal.</em></h5>

<p>Of the leguminous meals that of beans is chiefly used as an
adjunct in cocoa powders and chocolate, sweetened with saccharin,
on account of its relatively large proportion of albuminous substance
and small amount of starch. The meal is generally obtained from
the seed of the common white bean. (Phaseolus vulgaris.) The
starch granules under the microscope appear oval or long kidney
shaped, with distinct nucleus cavities and furrows, as well as a
distinctly marked stratification. Their length averages from 0·033 to
0·05 mm. The meal has a disagreeable leguminous taste when cooked,
but that disappears when the meal is slightly roasted.</p>


<h5>8. <em class="gesperrt">Salep.</em></h5>

<p>Salep which is now very seldom used as an admixture to
chocolate (Rakahout of the Arabs)<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> is an amylaceous powder prepared
from the tubers of various kinds of orchids. Under the
microscope salep appears as fairly large translucent masses which
consist of an agglomeration of very delicate walled cells giving the
starch reaction with iodine.</p>


<h4>III. Spices.</h4>


<h5>a) General Introduction.</h5>

<p>We cannot too strongly recommend the manufacturer to pulverise
the spices, e. g. cinnamon, cloves and the like, himself, for such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
as are bought ready pulverised have frequently been adulterated with
admixtures of wood, flour or bark. This is the more essential as
sometimes pulverised cinnamon is distilled with steam to obtain
an extract of its ethyl oil, and then the residue, which is of considerably
inferior value as regards aroma, sold as genuine cinnamon
powder. Such adulteration can neither be demonstrated under the
microscope nor chemically, so that it is impossible to protect oneself
against them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_239.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 97.</div>
</div>

<p>The edge runner mill and sieving apparatus described in connection
with the pulverising of sugar also adapt themselves to reducing
spices, although generally other machines are used for this purpose,
either the well-known ball mills<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> consisting of a hollow spherical ball
revolving round its axle, inside which the spices are shaken, crushed
and completely pulverised by the action of a number of heavy metal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
balls, or in other cases pulverising mills and stamping arrangements
proper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 98.</div>
</div>

<p>The following stamp arrangement, shown in fig. 97, is very practical in
the pulverisation of all manner of spices, and is driven by a force of 1·5 H.P.
The strong frame, which is walled in with iron, is dust-proof. Whilst the stamper
is being raised, the pots are revolved round their axles, and so the substances
to be pulverised are mixed together. Other machines much used in pulverising
are seen in fig. 94. Another smaller pulverising mill is pictured in fig. 98. This
machine is adapted for a middle sized production. The grinding arrangement in
which the pulverising takes place is conically built and is made completely of
granite; the regulation is effected by means of a working beam, the batting arm
of which is fitted on to the upper part of the apparatus. A sieving of the
material to be pulverised does not generally take place in this machine. For
small production for example for confectioners who manufacture chocolate also
incidentally, one can also use the machines pictured in the figs. 95 &amp; 99, the
method of working of which may be at once understood. The different degrees
of fineness of the material to be pulverised are reached by passing the powder
through drum sieves of different widths of mesh and all the sieves are set in
motion at the same time by the machines.</p>

<h5>Vanilla.</h5>

<p>Only the most important features of the spice so valuable in
chocolate making will be noticed, since the characteristic aroma of
the true vanilla has been to a large extent supplanted in practice by
artificially prepared vanillin.</p>

<p>Vanilla is the fruit capsule of an orchid, <em class="gesperrt">Vanilla planifolia</em>,
which is generally cultivated with the cacao tree, as the same
climate and soil suit them equally. According to Möller, the shoots
of the vanilla are fastened to the cacao tree, on the bark of which they
soon strike root. The aerial roots and tendrils then put forth fleshy
leaves, in the axils of which arise large odourless and dull coloured
flowers which yield after a lapse of two years long thin capsules.
The capsules are filled with a transparent balsam, in which the black
seeds are imbedded. It is in the balsam that the vanillin, which gives
vanilla its unequalled aroma, is produced. The fresh gathered vanilla
fruit (see the investigations of W. Busse<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> contains no free vanillin
or merely an infinitesimal quantity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 99.</div>
</div>

<p>It is rather developed by subsequent treatment in which heat
appears to be necessary. Vanillin, like cocoa-red and theobromine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
is formed by the splitting up of a glucoside by fermentative action.
In some kinds of vanilla, piperonal, an aromatic body, which occurs
in larger quantities in <em class="gesperrt">Heliotropium europaeum</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">peruvianum</em>, has also been observed.</p>

<p>The commercial kinds of vanilla come from Mexico, Tahiti,
Réunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, Seychelles, Ceylon and Java, which in
1891 produced respectively:</p>

<p>The best commercial kinds of vanilla come from Mexico, Bourbon,
and Mauritius, and command a higher price than the other kinds.
The quantity is gauged by the length (10-24 cm), and plumpness of
the pods. Fine quality is fatty and dark coloured, inferior quality is
dry and reddish. The outside of the pods in the Bourbon vanilla, contains
highly esteemed vanillin crystals, which are wanting in the
Mexican variety. Vanilla flowers in October and November, is gathered
in the following months of May, June, and July, and is prepared
in October and November. At the beginning of November the
first instalment of the new harvest arrives in Marseilles, which is
the chief commercial place for vanilla. The most important operation,
in preparing vanilla is to attain the proper degree of dryness. This
is arrived at nowadays by the use of calcium chloride. The pods are
first placed in a metallic box lined with wool which is placed in warm
water so as to superficially dry them; they are then transferred to
a suitable constructed drying closet containing calcium chloride and
allowed to remain there for 20-30 days. 100 pounds of vanilla are
reckoned to require 40 pounds of calcium chloride. The great advantage
of this process is that the fruit, so dried, better retains its
aroma.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Insufficiently dried vanilla does not keep, but soon becomes
mouldy, whilst overheated vanilla keeps well, but is brittle, breaks
easily and consequently has little commercial value. Vanilla covered
with mould (<em class="gesperrt">Aspergillus repens</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Mucor circinelloides</em>)
is sought to be improved in various ways and is sold
as of inferior quality.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> It is worth observing that those persons who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
in the course of business handle vanilla show characteristic symptoms
of poisoning. It affects the eyes and nervous system and produces
eruptions on the skin. The complaint, however, is not of a dangerous
nature, for the workmen quickly become accustomed to vanilla so
that, after recovering from the first attack, they can resume work
without risk to health.<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>On account of its high price, vanilla is much subjected to adulteration;
either by an admixture of the more cumarin-smelling vanillin
(Pompona or La Guayra Vanilla [Vanilla Pompona Schieder]) or
other less valuable vanilla fruit; sometimes pods that have been deprived
of vanillin by extraction with alcohol are used for that purpose;
their colour and appearance being restored by immersion in
tincture of benzoin and coating with crystals of benzoic acid, powdered
glass etc. In doubtful cases of adulteration the vanillin must be
quantitatively determined.</p>

<p>That can be done by W. Busse’s method<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>, in which the vanilla
is extracted with ether in a Soxhlet’s apparatus. The extract is shaken
with a solution of sodium bisulphite, the vanillin then set free with
sulphuric acid and the disengaged sulphurous acid removed by a
stream of carbon dioxide. The vanillin is then shaken out with ether
and on evaporating off the ether, vanillin is left in a pure condition.
Busse found by this method in East African vanilla 2·10 percent of
vanillin, in the Ceylon 1·48 percent, and in the Tahiti variety from
1·55 to 2·02 percent. In America the so-called vanilla extract,
instead of vanilla, is used and it lends itself to adulteration much
more easily than natural vanilla. William Hesse has given methods
and results obtained in the investigation of the extract.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>


<p class="center">5. <em class="gesperrt">Vanillin.</em></p>

<p>Vanilla in the chocolate industry has recently been almost
entirely superseded by the use of artificially prepared vanillin, which
serves as a complete substitute for the essential and valuable constituent
of vanilla. In comparing vanillin with vanilla, regard must be
had to the amount of vanillin in the latter, which may vary to the
extent of 50 percent according to whether the vanilla was damp,
dry, fresh or stored. The finest kinds of vanilla seldom contain more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
than 2 percent of vanillin and in many kinds it varies between 0·5 and
2·5 percent. It may also happen that vanilla with 0·5 to 1·0 percent
may be equally as fine in appearance as one of high percentage,
hence the aroma value must be taken into consideration. In addition
to possessing a uniform and permanent perfume vanillin is cheaper
in price.</p>

<p>Vanillin occurs naturally not only in vanilla but also in very
small amount in certain kinds of raw sugar, in potato skins and in
Siam benzoin; it can be produced artificially from coniferin which is
obtained from pine wood, or by the oxidation of eugenol, a substance
contained in oil of cloves, from both of which Tiemann and W. Haarmann<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
first prepared it in 1872. In the course of the last ten years a
number of processes have been discovered whereby vanillin can be
artificially produced. The reader who is interested in this subject will
find it fully discussed in a paper by J. Altschul in No. 51 of the Pharmazeutische
Centralhalle 1895.</p>

<p>The competition which arose through the processes of Haarmann
and Reimer of Holzminden and G. de Laire of Paris, whose
products owing to patent rights had controlled the market from the
commencement, produced a steady decrease in the price of vanillin.</p>

<p>The following table drawn up by J. Rouché<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> shows the revolution
in price which has occurred in this article and how, in the course
of time, a small business with large profits has been transformed into
a large business with small profits.</p>

<p>The chemical formula of vanillin is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(OCH<sub>3</sub>) (OH)CHO;
it melts between 82-83 ° C. and sublimes at 120 ° C. The colourless
four-sided crystals have a strong vanilla odour and taste, are difficultly
soluble in cold water, easily in hot water and very readily
soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p>Vanillin is much adulterated. Cumarin, the aromatic principle
of the melitot (<em class="gesperrt">meliotus officinalis</em>) and of tonquin beans etc.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
can be prepared cheaply and it is fraudulently used in large or small
quantity to imitate the vanillin aroma. A sample of vanillin bought
in Switzerland was found by Hefelmann<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> to contain 26 percent
of antifebrin. The American “vanilla crystals” consist of a mixture
of vanillin and antifebrin, or vanillin, cumarin and benzoic acid; latterly
that article is stated to consist only of cumarin, antifebrin and sugar.</p>

<p>The melting point of genuine vanillin is a characteristic indication.
Admixtures of vanillic acid and antifebrin cause depression
of the melting point (4-8 ° C. according to the amount and character
of the two substances [Welmans])<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>. For the quantitative determination
of vanillin in mixtures, Welmans takes advantage of its behaviour
towards caustic alkalis, with which, like phenol, it forms compounds
that are easily soluble in water, but sparingly so in alcohol.
The process is as follows: 1 gramme of the substance is placed in a
cylinder of 200 ccm capacity with 25 ccm of alcohol, 25 ccm of
approximately semi-normal alcoholic potash and 2 or 3 drops of
phenolphthalein solution and agitated until completely dissolved. The
excess of alkali is then titrated with semi-normal hydrochloric acid,
and, at the same time, the strength of the alcoholic potash after
adding 25 ccm of alcohol is ascertained. The number of cubic centimetres
consumed is multiplied by 0·076, the semifactor for vanillin. In
the case of vanilla sugar, 10 grammes are treated with 50 ccm of
water to dissolve the sugar, then the alcoholic potash is added and
the operation carried out as before described.</p>

<p>1 gramme of vanillin requires 6: 58 ccm of normal potash
(= 0·36842 g KOH).</p>

<p>If cumarin is suspected to have been added to the vanillin it
can be detected and separated, according to Zipperer’s experiments,
by the method of W. H. Hess and A. B. Prescott.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>The substance is dissolved in ether and the solution shaken up
with a weak solution of ammonia. The vanillin will be found in the
aqueous layer in the form of an ammonium compound, whilst the
cumarin will be dissolved by the ether. The vanillin can be identified
by the sandal-wood oil reaction as described by Bonnema,<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and the
cumarin can be determined by direct weighing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>The financial advantage in using vanillin in place of vanilla is
apparent. The average price of vanilla is now 45 to 50 shillings per
kilo. But as 25 grammes of vanillin are equal in perfume to 1 kilo of
vanilla and, at the rate of 35 shillings per kilo, that quantity costs
only 10½ vanilla is nearly sixty times dearer than vanillin. The
consumption of vanillin has increased to an enormous extent, and in
the United States Henning has estimated the consumption during
1897-1898 at over 100000 ounces. The same author points out the
remarkable fact that this enormous consumption of vanillin has
scarcely any effect on the demand for vanilla pods, the market value
of which is not only maintained but has a tendency to increase.</p>

<p>In order to have it in a finely divided condition, as required
for the factory, it is recommended to rub the vanillin down with
sugar, in the proportion of 100 grammes of vanillin to 2 kilos of
sugar, in the following manner; 100 grammes of vanillin are
dissolved in 500 grammes of hot alcohol and this solution
added to 2 kilos of finely powdered sugar; then the whole is
placed in a rotatory comfit boiler and dried by a blast of warm air
at 40 ° C. Whilst vanilla must be very carefully packed that it may
not become mildewed and deteriorate, vanillin on the other hand keeps
very well in such mixtures so long as they are kept from damp, which
might cause the sugar to ferment and thus gradually decompose the
vanillin.</p>


<h5>d) Cinnamon.</h5>

<p>There are three commercial kinds of cinnamon in Europe.</p>

<p>1. Ceylon cinnamon, which represents the finest kind, is the
bark of <em class="gesperrt">Cinnamomum ceylanicum</em>, a native of the island
of Ceylon. The bark is very light and brittle, seldom more than
0·5 mm thick, externally yellowish brown with long stripes, whilst
it is somewhat darker on the inside. Its fracture is short and fibrous,
and a traverse section shows externally a sharply defined light colour
with a darker inside zone.</p>

<p>2. Cassia or Chinese cinnamon is from <em class="gesperrt">Cinnamomum
Cassia</em>, a tree which grows wild in the forests of Southern China.
The bark is thicker than that previously described, often 2 mm thick.
It is in single tubes, harder and thicker than the Ceylon kind, with
frequently adherent fragmentary tissues of the corky layer. The
colour is a greyish brown, the fracture even, with a light zone
in the section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>3. Malabar or wood cinnamon consists of the less valuable
kinds and is derived from different varieties of cinnamon trees which
have been planted in the Sunda and Phillipine islands. In appearance
it resembles the Chinese more than the Ceylon cinnamon.</p>

<p>The aromatic taste of cinnamon is due to the ethereal cinnamon
oil which, in Ceylon cinnamon, amounts to 1 percent; the ash
should not exceed 4·5 percent. An ethereal oil is also present (about
1·8 percent) in the leaves of the Ceylon cinnamon tree, but it is
quite different from the bark oil, resembling in its properties more the
oils of cloves and pimento. On account of its penetrating odour and
pungent taste its employment in chocolate making is little to be recommended.</p>

<p>It cannot be too much insisted on that with spices like cinnamon,
cloves, etc. the manufacturer should grind them himself and not
purchase them in fine powder, as the latter is frequently adulterated
with admixtures of wood, meal bark, etc. This is more to be recommended
as ground cinnamon has frequently been deprived of the
ethereal oil by distillation with steam and the bark then flavoured
with a small amount of cinnamon oil and sold as powdered cinnamon.
Such an adulteration can be detected neither chemically nor
microscopically.</p>


<h5>e) Cloves.</h5>

<p>Cloves are the incompletely developed flowers of the clove
tree, <em class="gesperrt">Caryophyllusaromaticus</em> of the Myrtaceae. The most
important commercial kinds are the Zanzibar, Amboyna, and Penang
cloves. The aromatic principle of cloves is an ethereal oil which they
contain to the extent of 18 percent. The adulteration of cloves is
much the same as in the case of cinnamon. Genuine cloves should
not give more than 6 percent of ash.</p>


<h5>f) Nutmeg and Mace.</h5>

<p>Nutmeg is the seed kernel of the fruit of <em class="gesperrt">Myristica
moschata</em> known as the nutmeg tree, which is indigenous to
Malacca. In the thick pericarp of the fruit, resembling the apricot, is
found the brown seed surrounded by a deep red reticular mantle.
This last is the seed mantle or arillus and when separated from the
kernel is known commercially as mace.</p>

<p>The furrows on the surface of the nutty seeds are filled with
a white mass which consists of lime, in which the nuts have been laid
after drying in order to protect them from the attack of insects. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
aromatic constituent of nutmeg and of mace is also an ethereal oil.
The seeds contain 8-15 percent of ethereal oil with 25 percent of
a fatty oil; mace contains 4-15 percent of ethereal oil and 18 percent
of fatty oil. As both spices occur in commerce in whole pieces, adulteration
is not to be feared.</p>


<h5>g) Cardamoms.</h5>

<p>Of these there are two kinds on the market:</p>

<p>
1. The small or Malabar cardamoms.<br />
2. The long or Ceylon cardamoms.<br />
</p>

<p>Both are the fruit, although very different in form, of a species
of the ginger plants which is indigenous to Ceylon and Malabar.</p>

<p>The Malabar cardamom is three cornered oblong and about
1 cm in size. In the fine brown pericarps are enclosed, adhering
together, 6-8 angular seeds, 3 mm in size, having a pungent aromatic
taste.</p>

<p>The Ceylon cardamom is four times larger than the Malabar
kind. The grey brown pericarp encloses about 20 dark greyish brown
seeds about 6 mm large. The aroma of the Ceylon cardamom is due
to an ethereal oil which it contains in quantities sometimes reaching
6 percent. Madras and Malabar cardamoms contain 4-8 percent
of ethereal oil. As the Ceylon cardamoms are cheaper than the
Malabar kind a confusion of the two seeds might possibly be to the
disadvantage of the buyer, but the above description of their relative
size would suffice to distinguish them.</p>

<p>Exact accounts of the characteristic properties, the chemical
and microscopical investigation as well as of the impurities and adulterations
of the materials previously mentioned as being used in cacao
preparations are to be found in volume II of the “Vereinbarungen zur
einheitlichen Untersuchung und Beurteilung von Nahrungs-und Genußmittel
sowie Gebrauchsgegenständen für das Deutsche Reich”<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
to which those who desire further to investigate this subject are
referred.</p>


<h4>IV. Other Ingredients.</h4>


<h5>a) Ether oils.</h5>

<p>As previously remarked in the case of vanillin, it is becoming
more and more the custom to substitute perfume substances for
powdered spices. This practice is quite justified since the entire per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>fume
of a spice is made use of and the worthless woody and indigestible
fibre is thus excluded from the finished preparation.</p>

<p>The following are the ether oils used in practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Cinnamon oil,</li>
<li>2. Clove oil,</li>
<li>3. Cardamom oil,</li>
<li>4. Coriander oil,</li>
<li>5. Nutmeg oil (ethereal),</li>
<li>6. Mace oil (ethereal).</li>
</ul>


<p>The amount of ether oil that should be used in place of the
corresponding spice is a matter of taste. The maximum percentage
of the oil in the respective spice might serve as a standard, as for
example in the case of cinnamon oil, which is contained in the bark
to the extent of 1 percent, about the hundredth part of the oil would
be required to correspond with the prescribed weight of the bark.
But as the yield of oil from one and the same kind of spice varies to a
considerable extent according to season and locality, the percentage
value can only be used as a general guide, and the final decision must
be always regulated by the taste.</p>

<p>The ethereal oils can be incorporated in the cacao preparations
(mass, powder etc.) either in a spirit solution or ground down with
sugar. The latter method is naturally only used when sugar is to be
added to cacao preparations. To prepare the alcoholic solution
10 parts of the ethereal oil are dissolved in 90 parts of strong alcohol.
The mixture of oil with sugar can be made by triturating 2·5 parts of
the ethereal oil with 100 parts of sugar in a porcelain mortar and
grinding down with the pestle until the sugar and oil are intimately
mixed. Of the alcoholic solution it is necessary to take 10 parts, and
of the oil-sugar 40 parts to one part of ethereal oil.</p>


<h5>II. <em class="gesperrt">Peru balsam and Gum benzoin.</em></h5>

<p>Peru balsam is at present very much used as a perfume in
chocolate making. It is obtained from the <em class="gesperrt">Papilionaceous
Myroxylon Pereira</em> which is indigenous to the western part
of Central America. It is a thick, brownish black, liquid balsam which
in thin layers appears transparent and has a peculiar smell and
burning taste; it is almost completely soluble in alcohol, chloroform,
and acetic ether. The aromatic substance of this balsam is cinnameïn,
which consists essentially of the esters of benzoic and cinnamic
acids and benzyl alcohol together with an alcoholic body “Peruviol”,
which has the smell of honey. In addition to cinnameïn (71-77 per
cent) the balsam also contains a resin ester (13-17 percent). According
to K. Dieterich, Peru balsam is the better for containing more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
cinnameïn and less resin ester. Peru balsam is adulterated with
fatty oils, copaiva, gurjun-balsam, storax, colophony, turpentine, and
tolu balsam. In regard to the chemical investigation of this balsam
the work of K. Dieterich<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> may be consulted.</p>

<p>The Sumatra benzoin is the most important of the commercial
kinds for chocolate making. It is obtained from one of the Styracae,
Styrax benzoin, and is a reddish grey mass in which separate tiers
of resin are embedded. Benzoic acid and vanillin are the most important
constituents. It is adulterated with Palembang benzoin, colophony,
dammer, storax, and turpentine. Respecting the chemical investigation
of commercial benzoin the above-mentioned work of K.
Dieterich may also be referred to.</p>

<p>Benzoin is almost exclusively used for the preparation of chocolate
varnish and sweets laquer, which are prepared by dissolving
from 25 to 45 grammes of the laquer body in 100 grammes of strong
spirit. The laquer body may contain varying quantities of benzoin and
bleached shellac. The decorations of chocolate are painted with this
laquer in order to give them a glistening appearance and greater
durability.</p>


<h4>V. Colouring materials.</h4>

<p>The following colouring materials are permitted by the German
law of the 14th May 1879 to be used for sugar goods and consequently
also for chocolate and cacao preparations.</p>

<ul><li><em class="gesperrt">White</em>: finest flour starch.</li>

<li><em class="gesperrt">Yellow</em>: saffron, safflower, turmeric.</li>

<li><em class="gesperrt">Blue</em>: litmus, indigo solution.</li>

<li><em class="gesperrt">Green</em>: spinach juice as well as mixtures of the permitted
blue and yellow colours.></li>

<li><em class="gesperrt">Red</em>: carmine, cochineal, madder red.</li>

<li><em class="gesperrt">Violet</em>: mixtures of the harmless blue and red colours.</li>

Examination and Analysis of Cacao
Preparations.</h2>


<h3><a name="A_Chemical_and_microscopical_examination_of" id="A_Chemical_and_microscopical_examination_of">A. Chemical and microscopical examination of
cacao and cacao preparations.</a></h3>


<p>The following observations will serve as an introduction to the
chemical and microscopical examination of cacao preparations calculated
to be of special value to the food chemist, corresponding as
they do to the state of scientific progress at the present day and
special attention being paid to the critical treatment of the methods
of analysis etc. adopted.</p>


<h4>a) Testing.</h4>

<p>This is a point of great importance, inasmuch as it directly
influences the result of the analysis of cacao goods. This is especially
the case when dealing with <em class="gesperrt">cocoa powders</em>, as the test is liable
to vary considerably according to the amount of moisture contained
in the preparation and the degree of fineness of the powder. In the
case of cocoa powders, the sample should be taken repeatedly from
a large supply, and from all parts of the material to ensure getting
an average sample. The samples taken should be of uniform volume
and should, before proceeding to apply the test, be closely mixed
together, being, if possible, first passed through a fine sieve. The
material ready for the following experiments should then be placed in
tin, or better still, glass receptacles with well-fitting corks or stoppers.
Paper wrappings or cardboard-boxes are not to be recommended,
as the powder is apt to become drier or moister according to the
state of the atmosphere to which the packets are exposed.</p>

<p>The most suitable quantity for experimental purposes is, in
the case of both chocolate and cocoa powder, as well as butter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
covering material, 100 kilogrammes. When determining the amount of
foreign fat in cacao preparations, however, as well as estimating the
ash content of powder, up to 250 kilogrammes of sample material
can be used. In Germany the regulations of the Commercial Agencies
of the government public food chemists obtain when sampling and
analysing cacao preparations.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>


<h4>b) Chemical Analyses.</h4>

<p>The analyses of all cacao preparations from a chemical point
of view are conducted, almost without exception, with the object of
determining the values for <em class="gesperrt">moisture</em>—<em class="gesperrt">mineral matter</em>
(estimation of the amount of the carbonic acid alkalis and the silicic
acid)—<em class="gesperrt">fat</em> (estimation of foreign fat)—<em class="gesperrt">theobromine</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">coffeine</em>—<em class="gesperrt">sugar</em>—<em class="gesperrt">starch</em> (foreign starches)—<em class="gesperrt">albuminous
matter</em> and <em class="gesperrt">raw fibre</em>. The last regulation may also be
extended to the estimation of the quantity of shell present.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Estimation of moisture.</h5>
<p>1. <em class="gesperrt">Estimation of moisture.</em> 5 grammes of material
(i. e. fine-crushed chocolate mass) are left to dry (if possible in a
double-walled glycerine drying chamber) for about 6 hours at a temperature
of 105 Deg. C., the loss of weight of the material being
estimated as moisture. The drying should not be continued longer
than 6 hours, as fatty material is liable after the expiration of this time
to recover some of its weight, owing to the oxygen of the air entering
into chemical combination with the fat which rises to the surface or
detaches itself from the material. When analysing chocolate, great
care should be taken to prevent the mass from melting down and
running together at one point. If this occurs, the following treatment
must be adopted: A shallow watch-glass is filled with about 10 grammes
of sand, well washed and dried, a very fine sand such as so-called
sea-sand being preferable to others, the glass then transferred to the
drying closet, cooled, and finally 5 grammes of the fine-crushed chocolate
added. The mixture is then deposited for a period of 6 hours
in the drying chamber, at a temperature of 105 Deg. as indicated
above and the weight of the sand deducted when finally calculating
the value of the moisture.</p>

<p>If as low a quantity as 5 percent of gelatine has been added
to the chocolate, as much as 10 percent of water can be added
without in any way affecting the appearance of the material, although
such a proceeding is exceedingly detrimental to the taste and dura<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>bility
of the preparation. Such chocolates usually have a dull surface
and, if stored in a warm place, are apt to break up and become paler
in colour; this result can, however, be prevented by an extra addition
of fat. Too high a<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> fat content points in any case of additions of gelatine.
P. Onfroy<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> determines the addition of gelatine by boiling 5 grammes
of chocolate chips in 50 cubic centimetres of water, adding 5
cubic centimetres of a solution containing 10 percent of lead acetate,
and then filtering the whole. If gelatine is present in the chocolate,
the liquid, on a few drops of saturated picric acid being added, leaves
a yellow, amorphous sediment. If the addition of gelatine is very
trifling, the gelatine is held in check or neutralised by the tannic acid.
The defatting is then effected by ether and the chocolate stirred up
with 100 cubic centimetres of hot water. 5-10 cubic centimetres
of a solution of lye containing 10 percent of alkali and about 10 cubic
centimetres of the above-mentioned lead acetate solution are added.
The compound of gelatine and tannic acid is soluble in the hydrate
of the alkali, and is afterwards re-deposited by the action of the lead
acetate, so that it can easily be detected by means of picric acid in
the neutralised filtrate. As picric acid is incapable of effecting the
deposition of the theobromine, the deposition observed can only be
caused by the presence of gelatine.</p>

<p>Like gelatine and glue, the addition of a quantity of adraganth
has the power of binding the moisture and saving the fat. A method
of estimating the quality of this vegetable gum, of which at the most 2
percent should be present, has recently been described by Welmans;
this method is explained on page ... in the microscopic section.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Estimation of ash</h5>
<p>2. <em class="gesperrt">Estimation of ash</em><a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>: 5 grammes of material are
heated in a platinum vessel, pan or flat tray, the latter or other similar
shallow receptacle being the most suitable, holding from 25 to 30
cubic centimetres. Care should be taken when heating that the extremity
of the Bunsen flame only touches the bottom of the vessel.
The resulting gases are then ignited, and the <em class="gesperrt">completely</em> charred
mass pressed or stirred to a powder by means of a platinum wire or
rod hammered flat at the end; the pan should be frequently made to
revolve and its contents continually stirred during heating, care being
taken, too, to hold it slanting the whole time. The pan should be
held in this way over a moderate flame until the ash assumes almost
a white colour. As soon as this occurs, the pan should be cooled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
down and the ash uniformly saturated with a concentrated watery
solution of carbonate of ammonia, whereon the vessel is placed in
the drying chamber and dried at a temperature of 100 Deg. C. The
contents of the pan are then heated again very cautiously over the
Bunsen flame, care being taken that the bottom of the vessel is only
allowed to become red-hot very gradually and to remain so for a
very short time; the pan is then covered up and transferred to the
dessicator to be cooled, and, on the completion of this process, its
weight determined.</p>

<p>After repeating the saturating process with the solution of carbonate
of ammonia, drying and heating for a short time as previously
described, the accuracy of the weight first obtained is again tested.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Estimation of silicic acid in the ash</h5>
<p>3. <em class="gesperrt">Estimation of silicic acid in the ash</em>: When
examining cocoa powders and chocolate mass, the determination of
the silicic acid content of the ash is sometimes a necessity, as this
facilitates the detection of any shells which may have been added.<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
The ash <em class="gesperrt">of the cacao bean contains</em> only between 0·25
and 1·0 percent of silicic acid, while that of the shell
shows on analysis as much as 9 percent; it must, however,
be taken into consideration that an unusually high value for
silicic acid in the finished powder might be caused by impurities
in the chemical or other agents used to effect the disintegration
of the cacao. The signs of the presence of an extraordinary
quantity of silicic acid are, according to C. R. Fresenius
(Introduction to quantitative analysis)<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> a higher percentage of the
ash itself than usual, and the quantity of ash used for the test should
not be too small; it should further be remembered that certain cacao
preparations, such as, for instance, the Dutch cocoa powders, contain
large quantities of carbonic mineral matter, and the special treatment
explained by Fresenius when dealing with such preparations separately
should be applied.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Estimation of alkalis remaining</h5>
<p>4. <em class="gesperrt">Estimation of alkalis remaining in cocoa
powders.</em> The ash obtained from 5 grammes of cocoa powder is
washed out of the platinum pan into an ordinary water glass or
tumbler, distilled water only being used for this purpose, afterwards
finely crushed with a glass rod and heated to boiling point. The liquid is
then allowed to settle, filtered and re-washed. At this stage 5 cubic centimetres
of n/1 sulphurous acid are added, the liquid again heated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
boiling point and titrated with 2/n or n/4 alkaline lye. In this way the
quantity of added carbonic mineral matter is determined, in addition
to the amount of carbonate present in ordinary cocoa powders, which
is formed from the organic acid minerals when the ash is produced.
Welmans has determined these values in the commonest varieties of
beans and placed the results obtained at our disposal for the second
edition of this book. These results are as follows:</p>

<p>These tables show that:</p>

<p>1. The ash of cocoa powder (containing 33-1/3 percent of fat)
is never more than 5·5 percent.</p>

<p>2. The maximum amount of alkali (calculated as potash) is 1·2
percent.</p>

<p>3. The ash soluble in water is always less than that insoluble
in water. A reverse proportion shows a larger amount of alkali, that
is, alkali has been added.</p>

<p>In addition to the importance of determining the amount of
alkali in cocoa powder, it is very desirable that analytical chemists
should agree as to the methods to be adopted, since the determina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>tions
of alkali seldom agree and may differ as much as 0·3 percent.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
The method of calculating the results should also be defined, that is
to say, an agreement should be arrived at as to whether the alkali
should be expressed as K<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>Cacao which has been rendered miscible by means of ammonia,
sometimes contains a small amount of ammonia, probably in combination
with an organic acid. To detect it, the Cocoa powder should
be distilled with water, which gives an alkaline distillate, as the
ammonia salt would be decomposed at the temperature of boiling
water. The ammonia can be volumetrically determined in the
distillate with sulphuric acid.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<h5 class="blank">Determination of the Fatty Contents</h5>
<p>5. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of the Fatty Contents.</em> In this
operation 5 grammes of the finest powdered bean i. e. the finest cocoa
powder (in the case of chocolate, which must be finely flaked, 10
grammes) should be mixed with an equal quantity of evenly grained
quartz sand in a warmed mortar, and then transferred per filter to
a Soxhlet’s apparatus, wherein it can be extracted with ether for
from 10 to 12 hours at a stretch. The previously weighed carboy,
which now contains the fatty contents in solution, is placed on a
water bath, and the ether extracted as far as possible, after which
the fatty residue remaining is dried by first introducing the vessel
in a water oven and afterwards allowing it to stand for 2 hours in a
dessicator. The increase of weight in the flask is due to ether extract,
consisting almost exclusively of fat. It is true that small proportions
of theobromine will have been simultaneously dissolved (perhaps
about 0·1 g.) but no special significance need be attached to them. If
it should seem advisable to avoid even this slight drawback, petroleum
ether with a boiling point of 50° C. should be employed instead
of the ordinary variety.</p>

<p>Welmans<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> has further described a quick and practical method
for determining fat in cacao and its preparations, which is not only
of value as a check on the extraction method, but also serves as a
determination of the constituents soluble in water. It is carried out
as follows:</p>

<p>5 grammes of Cocoa powder or cacao mass, which need not
be very fine, or 10 grammes of chocolate are stirred for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
minutes in a separator or cylinder with 100 ccm of ether (saturated
with water) until coherent particles are no more visible, that is to
say, until the factory degree of fineness has been attained. In two
minutes all will have gone to powder even if the chocolate has not
been rubbed down but is in pieces; 100 ccm of water (saturated with
ether) are then added, and the mixture agitated until a complete
emulsion takes place. With powdered cacao, especially those kinds
rich in fat, that occurs in ½ to 1 minute, and with chocolate in 2
minutes. It is then allowed to rest until the emulsion separates, which
at the ordinary temperature of 15-20° C. usually occurs in 6-12
hours in the case of chocolate, and 12-24 hours with cacao. The
greater part of the water separates first and, usually, amounts to
90-98 ccm with chocolate and 70-86 ccm with cocoa. The powdery
portion of the cocoa or chocolate floats on the surface of the aqueous
layer at the bottom of the ether layer. Only husk, sand, particles of
cacao beans, added starch, etc. accumulate at the bottom of the
separator and are to be removed with the aqueous layer, which in
the case of chocolate contains the sugar, but usually no trace of
fat. The ether layer, which freely separates from the emulsion in the
time mentioned, is quite clear and from 25 to 50 ccm can generally
be pipetted off and an aliquot part poured into a measuring cylinder or
graduated tube, or into a 25 or 50 ccm flask. If the ether solution
of fat is not sufficient in quantity, the separation can be effected
after removing the aqueous liquid by twirling round the separator.
The turbidity soon disappears and the non-fatty particles quickly
sink to the bottom. The ether solution of fat can also be examined
aräometrically, as with milk fat, by Soxhlet’s aräometric method,
after forcing it by means of an india rubber ball, into a pipette or
burette, but the constants to be used in that case have not been ascertained.
After the ether has been distilled off, in the normal manner,
the weight obtained must be calculated for 100 ccm and a small
correction made. For example, if 50 ccm of the ether solution of fat
give a residue of 0·8 gramme, then 100 ccm represents 1·6 gramme.
But this 1·6 gramme has not been obtained from 100 ccm of the original
(water saturated) ether, but from 100-x ccm, x representing the
number of cubic centimetres corresponding to 1·6 gramme of cacao
butter and, as the specific gravity of cacao butter is nearly = 1;
the equation becomes (100-1·6): 100 = 1·6: x; x = 160/98·4
= 1·627 gramme; so that the 5 grammes of substance would contain
1·627 gramme of fat or 32·54 percent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>The remaining aqueous solution contains the whole of the constituents
of cacao or chocolate which are soluble in water. It is
measured into a graduated cylinder and its volume ascertained. Then,
after the entire amount has been evaporated to dryness, the residue
is calculated on a percentage basis. The following procedure,
however, is preferable. 10 ccm of the liquid are evaporated and the
residue well dried in a vacuum before it is weighed. Multiplying the
ascertained weight by 10, we obtain the amount of cacao or chocolate
soluble in water and present in 5 and 10 grammes of either substance
respectively. The amount of <em class="gesperrt">sugar</em> in the aqueous extract can be
determined in the following manner. 50 ccm of the extract are heated
in a water bath and thus separated from ether; afterwards 2 ccm of
lead acetate are added and the whole immediately transferred to a
special kind of filter paper. The solution is now polarised in the
usual way and the number of grammes of sugar thus ascertained converted
into ccm by division (1·55 being the unit) and then the result
subtracted from 100, which gives the volume of water present in
100 ccm of sugar solution, and so by further division until the percentage
of sugar in chocolate is finally obtained. If the polarisation
yields more sugar than the weight of the total residue, it is an indication
that dextrine is present as an adulteration. The quantitative
determination of dextrine, which is sometimes added to cocoa powder
as well as to chocolate, for like gelatine and tragacanth it holds water
together and so ensures a saving of fat, is best carried out in P. Welman’s
polarising method.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>As the amount of fat obtained from 5 grammes of a cacao
preparation does not suffice for tests of purity, a larger quantity must
be extracted in order to carry out the following investigations. This
has reference to</p>

<ul><li>1. The determination of the melting point;</li>

<li>11. Determination of the refractive index at 40° C. in Zeiss’ butter refractometer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following process is usually adopted in the determination
of the melting point of cacao fat:</p>

<p>The melted fat is sucked up a glass capillary tube, the internal
diameter of which does not exceed 2 mm (fluctuating between 1·8
mm and that measurement) to somewhat above the part of the tube
which is graduated into tenths, and then so much of the capillary tube
cut off as suffices to make the fat column there half the height of
the bulb of the mercury thermometer used in the experiment.</p>

<p>As fresh molten fat has a very variable melting point, it is
absolutely essential that the fat in this experiment be allowed
to cool about a week in some dark chamber, and, because only after
the expiration of this period can the melting point be designated as a
constant, not to proceed with the further determination until this
necessary stage has been reached.</p>

<p>To carry out this determination the capillary tube is attached
to the bulb of the mercury thermometer by means of a rubber
ring in such a manner that the column of fat occurs directly in the
middle.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus is now hung in a test tube of 2½ cm
internal diameter, which is just so far filled with water that this can
only penetrate to the fat in the capillary tube which is open at both
ends from the under side. To regulate the flow of heat, this test tube
is further introduced into a beaker also filled with water, which is
heated first. As soon as the fat is melted, the water penetrates to
the capillary tube and pushes along the fat column.</p>

<p>The reading is now taken at once the degree registered, the
thermometer showing the melting point of the fat.</p>

<p>We need not here launch on an exact description of the above
mentioned determination, but will only stay to point out the oft-mentioned
book of R. Benedikt’s, entitled “Analyses of Kinds of Fat
and Wax”, as enlarged and issued by F. Ulzer after the death of the
author (Berlin edition, J. Springer).</p>

<p>Should a doubt arise in comparing the results given by these
six tests, which may happen with some kinds of ordinary cacao butter,
the employment of Björklund’s empirical ether test<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> or Filsinge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>r’s
alcohol-ether test is to be recommended, which latter is carried out
as follows.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>3 grammes of cacao butter are dissolved in 6 grammes of ether
at 10° C. Should the resulting solution be clear, this is an indication
that no wax is present. The solution is then introduced in its test tube
into water at 0° C. and the length of the time which transpires before
it begins to become cloudy or to deposit flocculent matter, observed,
also the temperature when the solution again becomes clear.</p>

<p>If the solution becomes turbid before ten minutes have elapsed
the cacao butter is not quite pure. Pure cacao butter becomes turbid
in from 10 to 15 minutes at 0° C. and clear again at from 19-20° C.;
an admixture of 5 percent of tallow renders the solution turbid at
19-20° C. in 8 minutes and it becomes clear again at 22° C.; 15 per
cent of tallow give a turbid solution in from 4-5 minutes at 0° C. that
becomes clear again at 22·5-28·5 ° C. Filsinger<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> has suggested a
modification of Björklund’s test. In his method 2 grammes of the fat
are dissolved in a graduated tube in a mixture of 4 parts of ether (S. G.
0·725)) and 1 part of alcohol (S. G. 0·810). Pure cacao butter should
remain clear after some lapse of time, whereas foreign fats and more
especially tallow preparations cause a separation. But Lewkowitsch<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
maintains that this test is not be relied on, as genuine kinds of cacao
butter will crystallise out from the ether alcohol solution at 9° C. and
some at 12° C.</p>

<p>Yet we are nevertheless of the opinion that liquid fats are of
no great moment at the present time, for they always involve a considerable
lowering of the melting point and so greatly impair the
fracture of the chocolate. Fats such as tallow, or the like, must be
used, and these are detected both by their flavour and by Björklund’s
test. Adulteration is therefore very rarely met with in the German
chocolate industry, thanks to these facts and the rigid self-control
practised by the Association of German Chocolate Manufactures and
the sharp supervision exercised by the inspectors of articles of consumption
in that country. The only regularly occurring adulterations
are connected with the preparation of Cocoa powder and consist in
substitutions of finely ground cacao husk; the detection of which still
remains most difficult and uncertain; and even here it is rather the
Dutch firms which are culpable; and generally speaking it is a trick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
of smaller manufacturers, who consider such an admixture as quite
the normal procedure.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Determination of Theobromine and Caffeine</h5>
<p>6. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of Theobromine and Caffeine.</em>
Methods for the ascertainment of the quantity of theobromine are so
numerous that it would be impossible here to enter into the detail
of their advantages and disadvantages. Of the different processes
adopted in the determination of the cacao diureide perhaps only
Eminger’s is worthy of consideration at present, and this is described
fully in the following paragraphs, as best corresponding to our present
knowledge of the subject and its requirements, and most deserving
recommendation to chemists and food analysts on account of its
reliability.</p>

<p>For the practical testing of cacao preparations the splitting up
of the diureide has no special advantage and so we can at once proceed
to treat of the compound particle, though rather inclined to
maintain that the diureide has very little importance on the whole,
for it establishes no basis from which we can judge of the quality
of the various products.</p>

<p>The procedure in Eminger’s process is as follows:</p>

<p>10 grammes of powdered bean of cacao preparation are placed
in a weighed glass flask, then stirred up with 100 grammes of petroleum
ether and allowed to settle. The petroleum ether is next carefully
poured off, without disturbing the sediment, and the treatment repeated
several times. After the last decantation, the residue is well
drained, then dried in the flask and weighed. The difference in weight
of the residue and the former figure represents the amount of fat. An
aliquot portion of the residue (about 5 grammes) is then boiled with 100
grammes of a 3-4 percent strong sulphuric acid in a flask connected
with a reflux condenser, until cacao red is given as a resultant, a
task which occupies three quarters of an hour. The contents of the
flask are then poured into a beaker, and neutralised, whilst hot, with
barium hydroxide. The whole is then mixed with sand in a basin and
evaporated to dryness; afterwards the dry residue is introduced
into a Soxhlet apparatus on a paper cone, and there extracted for
5 hours with 150 grammes of chloroform. The latter is carefully
distilled off and the residue dried for a period of one hour at 100° C.
As previously stated, the separation of the two diureides is not necessary
and in commercial analyses it is sufficient to state the amount
of each separate substance after the removal of fat by means of some
suitable solvent. But should the splitting up be desired, then Eminger’s
method should be adopted, which depends on the solubility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of caffeine in carbon tetrachloride.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> With that object, the mixture
of fat, theobromine and caffeine is treated in the flask with 100 grammes
of carbon tetrachloride and repeatedly agitated for one hour.
After filtration, the carbon tetrachloride, which now contains fat and
caffeine, is distilled off. The theobromine left undissolved in the
flask and the filter used to filter the carbon tetrachloride solution
are then extracted with boiling water, the solution is filtered
and evaporated to dryness, the residue representing theobromine.
The separation of caffeine and theobromine can also be effected by
cautious treatment with caustic soda, so dissolving the theobromine
and leaving the caffeine untouched in its entirety.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> (Cf. Riederer.)</p>

<h5 class="blank">Determination of Starch</h5>
<p>7. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of Starch.</em> This can only be of
importance in rarer instances, as the starch naturally present in
raw cacao generally varies between 9 and 10 percent, and there is
no chemical method of separating foreign matter from cacao starch.
But should the necessity arise, a determination can be carried out as
follows.</p>

<p>In order to render the starch more easily gelatinisable, the fat
is first removed by treating 5 grammes of cocoa powder or 10 grammes
of a cacao preparation with ether and then with an 80%
solution of alcohol to separate any sugar, theobromine and cacao
red. The residue is then mixed with water and subjected to a steam
pressure of from three to four atmospheres, which converts the
starch into a soluble body known as amylo-dextrine. This operation
is generally carried out in an autoclave or strong copper vessel<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
provided with an air-tight and removable cover, the open flask, containing
the sample to be gelatinised (1 part of cacao and 20 parts of
water) being placed in the vessel half immersed in water.</p>

<p>After screwing on the lid, the temperature of the interior of
the vessel is raised to 133-144° C. corresponding to a pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of 4 atmospheres, and maintained at that pressure for three or four
hours in order to allow the action to proceed on the mass for
gelatinisation of the starch. The flask is then removed from the
apparatus and the contents allowed to settle for a few minutes;
the liquid is filtered hot, the filtrate amounting to about 250 or
300 ccm after the filter has been washed a few times with hot
water. Only the cell fibre remains on the filter, whilst the starch
is dissolved in the filtrate. This is now heated with 20 ccm of
hydrochloric acid in a flask connected with a reflux condenser,
whereby the starch is converted into dextrose. The sugar solution
is neutralised with sodium carbonate, clarified with basic lead acetate,
any excess of the latter being removed with sodium sulphate,
finally filtered, and the whole made up to 500 ccm. The sugar is
determined in this solution by titration with alkaline copper sulphate
solution and from the number of cubic centimetres required for the
precipitation of the red cuprous oxide, the quantity of sugar can be
ascertained. As 99 parts of starch are equal to 108 parts of dextrose
or grape sugar, the following calculation must be made.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="center">dextrose starch</td>
  <td align="center" rowspan="2">=</td>

  <td align="center" rowspan="2">:x</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center">108:99</td>
  <td align="center">&nbsp;found</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the determination of sugar with copper sulphate it is more
advantageous to follow up F. Allihin’s<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> method, in which the cuprous
oxide is reduced by hydrogen gas to metallic copper, weighed as
such, and so the sugar calculated, or the cuprous oxide can be collected
on an asbestos filter and weighed in that condition. The
cuprous oxide must be previously washed with hot water, alcohol
and ether, which must be completely removed by subsequent drying
in the air bath, since an error of even 1 milligramme would seriously
affect the final result. Then again, the amount of sugar may be determined
by polarisation, a process which has also its own particular
advantages.</p>

<p>The chemical determination of starch is only in a limited degree
effectual in a recognition of an admixture of foreign starch in cacao
preparations. If more than 10-15 percent of starch, as calculated on
the crude bean, has been found, it must certainly be assumed
that there is an admixture of foreign starch, but chemistry affords
no assistance by which foreign starch may be separated from the
genuine starch of the cacao bean. For that purpose the foreign starch
must be observed under the microscope, which not only serves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
detect its presence but affords a means of estimating the amount
present to an approximate degree, and its characteristics. Great
care should be exercised, or the result may be easily exaggerated.
Standard preparations, i. e. which have a known percentage of starch
constituent, prove very serviceable when comparing.</p>

<p>If Welman’s agitation method has been used for determining
the fat, the starch will be found in the sediment. The amount of
foreign starch can also be determined by Posetto’s<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> method, which
depends on the intensity and permanency of the iodine reaction. In
the latter test 2 grammes of the powdered or finely divided cacao
preparation are boiled with 20 ccm water in a test tube for
2 minutes, cooled, and without disturbing the liquid, 20 ccm
of water and 5 ccm of iodine solution (5 grammes of iodide and
10 grammes of potassium iodide in 100 ccm of water) are added. The
liquid from genuine cacao, according to the variety used, turns
brownish or light blue, changing in a short time (12 minutes at the
most) to brown and red. On the other hand, chocolate or a cacao
preparation adulterated with not more than 10% wheaten or potato
starch, chestnut, maize or commercial dextrine, will give a blue
coloration lasting for 24 hours. It must be noted that the result
in Posetto’s test is influenced by the amount of alkali, so that with
disintegrated cacao, for instance, a considerable quantity of iodine
has to be added before the blue coloration takes place, and this more
especially if the potassium carbonate employed contained caustic
alkali. Such preparations finally become coloured, but generally
show a mixed colour (blue and yellow): green to greenish brown.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Determination of crude Fibre</h5>
<p>8. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of crude Fibre.</em> This can be
carried out in two ways; either by König’s new process as employed
by Filsinger for cacao or by the older method of Weender’s<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> as
follows:</p>

<p>3 grammes of the defatted and atmospherically dried substance
are boiled for ½ hour with 200 ccm of a 1·24 percent solution
of sulphuric acid. It is allowed to settle, then decanted, and the residue
boiled twice with the same volume of water. The decanted liquids
are allowed to settle in cylinders and the sediment added to the rest
of the substance, which is then boiled half an hour with 200 ccm of
a 1·25 percent solution of caustic potash, filtered through a weighed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
filter and the residue twice boiled with 200 ccm of water. The
cellulose-like substance collected on the filter is washed first with
hot water, then with cold, afterwards with alcohol, and finally with
ether.</p>

<p>After being dried and weighed, it is incinerated and the necessary
corrections made for ash.</p>

<p>The process worked out by Henneberg is the one usually
adopted for the determination of crude fibre in vegetable matter.
Recently H. Suringer and B. Tollens<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and more particularly König<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
have pointed out that in Weender’s process the so-called pentosan
(sugar derivative) of the composition C<sub>5</sub> H<sub>10</sub> O<sub>5</sub>, which comprises a
not inconsiderable portion of crude fibre, would undergo a disproportionate
alteration, so that the analytical results thus obtained
would not represent the amount of cellulose correctly. The crude
fibre must therefore be treated in such a manner as to eliminate the
pentosan. König attains that result by treating 3 grammes of the
defatted substance with 200 ccm of glycerine (1·23 sp. gr.) containing
per litre 20 grammes of concentrated sulphuric acid, under a pressure
of three atmospheres, for one hour. It is then filtered through an
asbestos filter whilst hot, and after being successively washed with
hot water, alcohol and ether, it is weighed, incinerated and the ash
weighed. The difference between the two weighings expresses the
amount of ash-free crude fibre.</p>

<p>Filsinger has determined by König’s method the amount of
crude fibre in a series of different varieties of bean, the results of
which have already been given on page 72. Which process is the
better has yet to be established, and in issuing results as data the
method employed has always to be indicated owing to the many
variations which arise.</p>

<h5 class="blank">The determination of cacao husk</h5>
<p>9. <em class="gesperrt">The determination of cacao husk</em>, which will
be for the most part a matter of ascertaining the amount of raw or
crude fibre, could formerly only be effected by means of the microscope.
In 1899 Filsinger<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> proposed a method of levigation which
according to P. Welman’s<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> gives trustworthy results. Manifold treatises
have been devoted to the subject, and it would be advisable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
to turn a few of these up and compare the details of the accounts.<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>
In this method, which works best with the modifications suggested
by Drawe (see below) 5 grammes of cocoa or chocolate are defatted
with ether and dried, then ground in a mortar after a little water
has been added, and levigated with about 100 ccm of water in a
cylinder. The liquid is allowed to rest for some time and the suspended
matter poured off almost to the sediment, which is again shaken
up with fresh water, allowed to settle, and the operation repeated
until all the fine particles have been floated off and the water over
the sediment no longer becomes cloudy, but remains clear after the
coarse and heavy particles have settled down.</p>

<p>The powdery sediment is collected on a watch glass, dried
in the water bath, and after being cooled down in a desiccator, weighed.
The weighed residue is then softened with caustic soda and
glycerine and examined under the microscope. The presence of
any cotyledon particles must be carefully observed, such as have
escaped separation in the grinding and levigation, and whether particles
of husk or epidermis or germ preponderate. With proper
levigation only traces of cacao substance, especially here recognisable
by the cacao starch, should be present. The sand, which
always adheres to the shells in the fermenting and drying operations,
is also easily recognised and many indications as to the nature of
the article under investigation can be noted by the use of a simple
magnifying glass applied to the washed residue on the watch glass
before drying.</p>

<p>Examined in that way, a sample of so-called Cocoas from
unshelled beans gave from 6 to 8 percent of husk; usually good
cacao powder shows a maximum of 2·5% husk. It is true
that from this Filsinger-Drawe procedure the correct percentage of
shell can only be estimated in very rare instances, for when it is
necessary to be absolutely fair to all concerned in the manufacture,
the cacao must be so often washed until no grains of cacao starch
are visible under the microscope; and so the result is often too small,
more especially in the case of the finer qualities. But when all
particles of starch have been removed, the finer particles of shell
have often been taken along with them. Yet when the residue certainly
exceeds the standard percentage of shell, it may be taken for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
granted that adulteration with husks has been carried to excess,
or that the cleansing processes have not been effectively carried
out. There is no other method which yields the same degree of
certainty.</p>

<p>The result obtained by the levigation method can be controlled
by the previously mentioned methods of Weender or Filsinger,
as well as by the determination of any silica in the ash (page 256).</p>

<p>Latterly the admixture of cacao husk with the cheaper kinds
of cocoa powder has largely increased, therefore the determination
of the amount of husk in cacao preparations has become of special
importance.</p>

<h5 class="blank">>Determination of sugar</h5>
<p>10. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of sugar.</em> There are three
methods for the quick determination of sugar, two of them polarimetric
and the third consisting of taking the specific gravity of the
solution obtained by shaking up the cacao with water. It is as well
to note that in all these methods the result includes the normal
amount of sugar in cacao, which Welmans<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> gives at 0·75-2 in cocoa
and 0·4-1·0 percent in chocolate. That source of error is of no
special significance, for, as Welmans has shown, it is compensated
for in the course of the succeeding operations, so that these methods
are of service.</p>

<p>For official investigations under this head the statutes of May
31st 1891 and May 27th 1896 respectively together with the instructions
issued by the council concerning the carrying out of the process
(Berlin, July 9th 1896, and Nov. 8th 1897, E) constitute a standard.</p>

<p>They read as follows: “Half the normal weight (13·024 g) of
chocolate is damped with alcohol and then warmed for 15 minutes
with 30 ccm of water on the water bath. While still hot, it is
poured on to a wet filter, the residue again treated with hot water,
and until the filtrate nearly amounts to 100 ccm. The filtrate is to be
mixed with 5 ccm of basic lead acetate solution, allowed to stand
for a quarter of an hour, then clarified with alum and a little alumina,
made up to a definite volume (110 ccm) and polarised.” But it is
to be noted that these instructions are not exhaustive enough, and
prove particularly deficient as regards the employment of water, also
through their non-observation of the errors which can arise in using
basic lead acetate, though it is true that these are only of a minor
character.</p>

<p>The Berlin chemist Jeserich (ex officio) had a rather hot
dispute with the official over the matter, who declared that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
results were false in spite of all protest, until he finally proved that
it was not these results but the process advised by law which
lacked correctness. He described the rencontre in very lucid if
drastic detail to an assembly of official chemists.</p>

<p>Something similar happened to the present editor, who in his
office of sworn chemist was called upon to determine the amount
of sugar and starch present in certain crumb chocolates on the one
hand, and the amount of cacao material on the other. As the official
inspectors insist on their prescriptions being carried out with scrupulous
exactitude, he found it necessary to give a double result, the one
in accordance with these prescriptions, and the other when double
the amount of water was used, taking care to explain the whole
matter at length. But it occasioned some surprise, and finally the
task of investigating and testing was withdrawn and given to
another.</p>

<p>Another polarimetric method, recommended by Woy<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>, is carried
out as follows. Two portions of half the normal weight (13·024
grammes) of rasped or shaved chocolate are placed in 100 ccm and
200 ccm flasks respectively, moistened with alcohol, then treated
with hot water and stirred up till the sugar is dissolved. 4 ccm of basic
lead acetate solution are added to each flask, by which means the
chocolate in suspension loses its viscosity. After being cooled, the
solutions are made up to the marks, well mixed and filtered. Two
quickly filtering liquids are thus obtained, which are then polarised
in 200 mm tubes. With chocolate containing meal, the temperature
must not exceed 50° C. From the two polarisations, the following
equation results: a (100-x) = b(200-x), in which <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the
results of polarising, and x the volume of the insoluble substances,
including the lead precipitate, contained in the half normal weight.
The product of the equation gives the amount of sugar present.
Woy’s method has the great advantage of avoiding the error due to
the volume of the undissolved cacao and lead precipitate.</p>

<p>The third method, as adopted by Zipperer<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>, is as follows:
50 grammes of chocolate, finely divided with an iron grater or rasp,
are treated with exactly 200 ccm of cold water, frequently stirred
for 4 hours, then poured on to a previously moistened and well wrung
pointed bag. The specific gravity of the filtrate is taken in an araeometer,
specially constructed for the purpose by Greiner of Munich
on lines suggested by Zipperer himself. On the scale of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
araeometer is given the percentage amount of sugar in the chocolate,
from 5 to 5 percent, with subdivisions of one percent, so that the
reading can be quickly taken, without correction.</p>

<p>In the determination of sugar by weight, the chocolate is first
defatted with ether, the sugar extracted with alcohol, then inverted,
the inverted solution treated with Fehling’s solution and the copper
precipitate weighed. The process has little to recommend it, being
troublesome and admitting of a large margin of errors.</p>

<p>Here again much has been written of late<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> concerning the two
former methods, their liabilities to error and the avoidance of these,
yet without bringing to light anything which calls for a specially
detailed treatment in this book.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Determination of Albuminates</h5>
<p>11. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of Albuminates.</em> The determination
of albumin is frequently required in the analysis of cacao
powder and is necessary to the ascertainment of its nutritive value.
The determination of nitrogen is determined by mixing 0·5 grammes
of finely powdered bean with soda lime and burning the mixture in
a tube. (This determination of nitrogen is a necessary part of the
process.) Thus ammonia is formed, which is passed through a known
quantity of sulphuric acid. When the combustion is finished, the
acid solution is titrated with a standard solution of barium hydroxide,
and from the quantity consumed the percentage of nitrogen is calculated.
But as the diureides also contain nitrogen (31·1 % of the
theobromine and caffeine present) the nitrogen corresponding to this
amount must be deducted from the total quantity of nitrogen yielded
by combustion and the remainder multiplied by 6·25 will indicate the
amount of albumen present as a constituent.</p>

<p>Another and better method of determining the nitrogen is by
Kjeldahl’s<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> process. It has been frequently subjected to modifications,
but was originally carried out as follows. 0·25 grammes of the nitrogenous
substance (cacao preparation) is heated on the sand bath
together with 20 ccm of concentrated sulphuric acid and a little
quicksilver, till the solution becomes colourless or only of a very
pale yellow. After diluting with about 200 ccm of water, it is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
alkaline by the addition of soda lye (which must of course be entirely
free from nitrogen, the same remark applying to the sulphuric acid
used) and, potassium or sodium sulphide being added, it is then distilled,
and the ammonia given off collected and determined as above
described. As this method also determines the total amount of nitrogen,
an allowance must be made for the nitrogen in the theobromine
and caffeine before multiplying the result by 6·25. This modification
is still to be recommended as the best and most reliable.</p>

<p>In rare cases an excessive amount of albumen may be due to
the admixture of earth-nut cake or gelatine. As to the detection of
the latter adulteration, see page <a href="#Page_254">254</a>. Bileryst<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> says that earth-nut
cake can be recognised by its high percentage of albumen content,
amounting to between 45 and 47 percent.</p>

<h5 class="blank">Investigation of Milk and Cream Chocolate</h5>
<p>12. <em class="gesperrt">Investigation of Milk and Cream Chocolate.</em>
The tests bearing on these products really constitute a chapter
in themselves, which has acquired special importance owing to
the great popularity they enjoy and the consequently greatly increased
production. According to the unanimous opinion of the Association
of German Chocolate Manufacturers and the Free Union of
German Food Chemists, expressed when considering the respective
claims of such chocolates, it is chiefly if not exclusively a matter of
determining the percentage of milk or cream, which ought not to be
below 12·5 or 10%, always supposing the milk or cream to be a
substitute for sugar, and this means therefore that the quantity of
cacao material in the chocolate product should on no account sink
below 32%. (Cf. p. 283 No. 3. Abs. 5.) The method employed in the
investigation is generally the same as that suggested by Laxa in
his treatise on “Milk Chocolates”<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> although it has been considerably
improved by Baier and his colleagues.<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> It is here a matter of
working backwards from the determination of the fatty and nitrogenous
components (or caseine) to the amount of milk or cream in the
chocolate. This presents a certain amount of difficultly as it is not
only necessary to determine the milk, but also to establish that
neither skimmed or whipped material (either in part or entirely) has
been employed. Yet it is possible here to proceed with absolute certainty,
as Baier<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> convincingly demonstrates, by taking into consideration
the relative proportion of milk fat, called caseum or caseine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>If it is desired finally to characterise the respective chocolates,
determinations of the <em class="gesperrt">quantity</em> of milk fat present and the
amount of milk product used become essential. Baier gives both as
calculable (cf. footnote 1)<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>, the Reichert-Meissl number of the total
fat being ascertained, and from this, subtracting the R.-M. number of
the cacao fat present<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> the quantity of milk fat, finally the
amount of caseine, milk sugar, mineral matter and other factors.
No details of this somewhat extensive calculation are proved in the
original.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> We give the following regulations (Laxa-Baier) for
carrying out the determination of the caseine, together with the
necessary formula.</p>

<p>20 grammes of fine divided chocolate are loosely introduced into
a Soxhlet’s extracting apparatus, and there extracted with ether for
a period of 16 hours. Of the residue, 10 grammes are used for
testing in connection with caseine, and this after the ether has evaporated.
These are mixed up in mortar with gradual and even addition
of a 1% solution of sodium oxalate, so that no lump formations occur,
and then brought into a marked carboy of 250 ccm capacity, until
200 ccm of the sodium oxalate solution have been used. The carboy
is then provided with an asbestos net, and heated by means of a
flame from the under side, until its contents are brought to boil. The
mouth of the carboy is covered with a small funnel which has been
hermetically sealed at its narrower end. Then boiling oxalate solution
is poured into the vessel up the bend, and it is then allowed to stand
over till another day, shaking however being often repeated, then
filled with sodium oxalate solution up to the mark, agitated with a
regular motion, and then filtered through an ordinary filter. To
100 ccm of this solution 5 ccm of an uranous acetate solution (5%
strong) and drop by drop and with repeated stirring a 30% solution
of acetic are added until there is a deposit. (This will require
from 30 to 120 drops, according to the amount of caseine present.)
Then an extra 5 drops of acetic acid can be added. This causes the
deposit to stand out clearly from the liquid matter and it can be
readily separated by centrifugalising. Afterwards it can be washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
out with 100 ccm of solution, of which 5 ccm are uranous acetate and
3 ccm acetic acid 3 % strong, until the sodium oxalate can no longer be
seen on adding calcium chloride (i. e. after about three repeated centrifugalisations).
The contents of the tube are then rinsed on to the
small filter by means of the wash fluid, stirred in a Kjeldahl carboy
with concentrated sulphuric acid and copper oxide, and the quantity
of nitrogen found converted into caseine by multiplying with the
factor k = 6·37.—Bearing in mind the quantity of fat, the percentage
of caseine in the original chocolate is calculated.<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>In the following:</p>

b = signifies the total of fatty content of the chocolate<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>,<br />

<p>Cacao is to no great extent particularly characterised anatomically.
The parenchyma cells fig. 100 are chiefly to be noticed, containing
either fat, albumin (protoplasm) aleuron granules, pigment, or
cacao starch. The <em class="gesperrt">starch</em>, as already remarked, consists of
especially small globular granules, mostly separate, but also two or
three adherent. It is somewhat more difficult to gelatinise than other
kinds of starch, and it is coloured blue by iodine somewhat more
slowly than many other starch granules, especially in the preparations
containing fat. Cacao preparations which have been disintegrated by
fixed alcalis, differ in this respect; according to Welmans, iodine
first forms colourless iodine compounds, and not until the alkali has
been saturated, is the blue colour developed. In such cases, care must
be taken, that an excess of iodine is present. In estimating the amount
of foreign starch, great care must be taken that the conspicuous
bluish-black granules of the foreign starch, which immediately strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
the eye, are not over estimated, which may easily occur. For control
observations, mixtures containing various known amounts of starch
should be tried comparatively. The pigment cells and the epidermis
with the Mitscherlich’s particles (figs 101 and 102) should be noticed
as well as the characteristic globoids, which occur in the ash of the
cotyledon tissues (compare page 67). The <em class="gesperrt">outside shell</em>, more
or less woody according to the origin of the bean, consists of four
layers of cells; this is best recognised by the large cells of the principal
tissue, which are distinguished by their form as well as by their
thickened side walls from the tissue of the cotyledon. Another
characteristic of this layer consists of the large number of
coarse spiral vessels, which exceed those of the seed lobes in size,
and finally, the inner elements of the stone cell layer, which, however,
on account of their limited development are seldom to be
discovered. The smooth, fine brown coloured, and light refracting
fragments, which frequently appear quite structureless and have their
fibrous character made perceptible only after treatment with caustic
alkali, must be regarded as characteristic of the inner part of the
husk or the seed membrane. The best observing medium is a solution
of chloral hydrate or almond oil, as well as dilute sulphuric acid and
glycerine.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> The substance is always to be defatted with ether,
before the microscopical examination. A complete extraction of the
fat, according to Welmans, can occur only with exceedingly thin
cuttings, in which every cell of the section would be operated on,
or in powdered preparations, when the cells have been completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
torn asunder by mechanical pulverisation. The fat is not extracted
by solvents from intact cells, as the cell walls are impermeable by
them.<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>The detection of <em class="gesperrt">foreign starch</em> is possible only by use
of the microscope; by means of standard preparations an approximate
estimate may be made as to the amount and kind of meal added.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
The examination of starch is especially facilitated by H. Leffmann
and W. Beam’s<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> centrifugal method: the sample suspended in water
is subjected to rotation for a short time in the centrifugal apparatus.
The presence of foreign starch is shown by a white layer in the
resulting sediment. This layer can be collected and microscopically
examined for foreign starch and husk. In the case of cacao preparations,
it is always well to distinguish between unimportant traces
and quantities that justify objection.<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>A means of detecting <em class="gesperrt">tragacanth</em> in cacao preparations,
has lately been described by Welmans<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>. 5 grammes of the cacao
preparation are to be mixed with sufficient dilute sulphuric acid (1: 3)
to form a thick pulp, then with 10 drops of solution of iodine (in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
potassium iodide) and some glycerine. A portion of the mixture is
examined under the microscope (enlarged 160 times). The entire
field of view now appears to be thickly sown with countless blue
dots, some globular, others irregular, among which are especially to
be noticed the large tragacanth cells, resembling potato starch, which
are not seen in cocoa powder that is free from tragacanth, when
similarly prepared as an object; the small blue dots, due to cacao
starch, are visible only in the densely occupied portions.</p>

<p>An admixture of the <em class="gesperrt">carob</em>, which has been seldom observed,
can be easily recognised under the microscope by the characteristic
reddish wrinkled tubes of the fruit pulp, which are also coloured
violet by treatment with a warm solution of caustic potash.</p>

<p>The presence of <em class="gesperrt">earth-nut or earth-nut cake</em> can
be detected by the aid of the microscope on treatment with chloral
hydrate, by the characteristic saw toothed epidermis cells of the
husk of arachis seed.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Hazelnut and walnut pulp</em>, so far as they are to be
met with in cacao preparations, can be distinguished under the
microscope by shreds of the tissue of the seed husks, in which broad
streaks of spiral vessels, lying close on one another, are distinctly
prominent. If in addition the woody fruit shell be admixed, it can be
detected by the great number of cells.</p>

<h3>B. Definitions of Cacao Preparations.</h3>

<p>The following formulae have been compiled by the Association
of German Chocolate Manufacturers for the purpose of fixing the
definition of cacao, and we may say that we agree with same in the
main, as they satisfy all just claims, and keep pace with the progress
made in consequence of the introduction of the modern machinery
now in use, both from a scientific and practical point of view. Only
in a few points are we of different opinion, and have referred to such
clearly in their place.</p>

least 10 % of fat, and in such a manner that at least 10 % of
a cream powder or the corresponding amount of cream, in
each case containing 50 % of milk fat, are employed. It may be
varied to taste with milk proper or its powder, without any
further declaration being necessary.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>These percentages represent a minimum. It remains at the
manufacturer’s choice whether he shall employ larger quantities of
cream or milk.</p>

<p>The associated firms are further recommended to annex the
following guarantees:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="hangsection">
<p>a) that the powder of milk proper contain at least 26 % of fat
and be prepared from a milk guaranteed as pure;</p>

<p>b) that the cream powder contain at least 40 % of milk or be
prepared from cream containing at least 10% of fat.</p></div></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>It is especially emphasised that these quantities are minimums,
and every manufacturer is free to add as much cream or milk
as he pleases.</p>

<p>We particularly recommend the procuring of a guarantee from
the milk purveyor as to its purity for every delivery in order to be
covered against fines in case the product should prove to contain
an insufficient amount of fat. Analytical testings of trial samples are
also to be recommended.</p>

<p>By way of comparison we refer to the “Principles for Estimating
Cacao Products and their Food Value” determined by the Free
Union of German Food Chemists in their 8th annual assembly at
Heidelberg (1909) and finally established in their 10th held at Dresden
(1911), which are said to have found general acceptance from the
1st July, 1912.</p>


<h4><b>b) Final Wording of the Principles of the Free Union of German Food
Chemists for the estimation of the Value of Cocoa and Cacao Preparations.</b></h4>


<h5>I.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cacao mass</em> is the product which is purely and simply
obtained from the roasted and shelled cacao bean by grinding and
moulding.</p>

<p>Cacao mass may not contain any kind of foreign substance.
Traces of shell may only be present in minor quantity. The waste
product falling in the cleansing of the bean must not be added to the
cacao mass, nor may it be worked up into cacao material
separate and apart from other cacao.</p>

<p>Cacao mass shows 2·5-5% of ash and contains 52-58 % of fat.</p>

<p>Disintegrated cacao is such material as is treated with alkalis
or alkaline earths, ammonia or its salts, under pressure of steam.</p>


<h5>II.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cocoa powder</em>, cacao that has been pressed and its oil
removed, soluble Cocoa and disintegrated cacao are synonyms for
cacao mass which has been reduced to powder form after they have
been partially separated from fat by expression under heat; and
generally treatment with alkalis or their carbonates, alkaline earths,
ammonia, and ammonia salts under a strong steam pressure are
presupposed.</p>

<p>Cocoa powder containing under 20% of fat, as well as that
treated with spices (aromatised or scented) must be declared
accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>Cocoa powder may not contain any kind of foreign substance.
Traces of shell may only be present in minor quantity. The waste
product falling in the cleansing of the bean may neither be added to
the cocoa powder nor itself worked up into such a powder.</p>

<p>The added alkali or alkaline earths may not exceed 3 % of the
raw material.</p>

<p>Only powdered cacao and cocoa powder which has been
treated with ammonia and its salts under strong steam pressure shows
from 3 to 5 % of ash on cacao mass containing 55 % of fat.</p>

<p>Cocoa powders disintegrated with alkalis and alkaline earths
must not show more than 8 % of ash on cacao containing 55 % of fat.</p>

<p>The percentage of water must not rise above 9.</p>


<h5>III.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em> is a mixture of cacao material with beetroot or
cane sugar and a proportionate admixture of spices (vanilla, vanillin,
cinnamon, cloves and so forth). Many chocolates contain apart from
that an addition of cacao butter.</p>

<p>The percentage of sugar may not amount to more than 68.</p>

<p>Addition of substances for dietetic and medicinal purposes is
permissible, and then the total of sugar and such addition must not
exceed 68% of the whole.</p>

<p>Apart from the addition of spices no other vegetable admixtures
are permissible. Nor may chocolate contain any foreign fat or
foreign mineral constituents. Cacao shells may only be present in
faint traces. The waste product falling in the cleansing of the bean
must not be added to the cacao mass, nor may it be worked up into
cacao material itself.</p>

<p>Chocolates which contain meal, almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts
and milk stuffs must be provided with a declaration indicating such
addition precisely, and here again the total addition of foreign ingredients
shall not exceed 68 %.<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>The percentage of ash constituent shall not exceed 2.5.</p>


<h5>IV.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Covering or coating material</em> must satisfy the requirements
holding good for chocolate even when the coated goods
bear declarations in which the words cacao or chocolate do not expressly
occur, although admixtures of nuts, almonds and milk stuffs
not exceeding a total of 5% may be made without declaration.</p>


<h5>V.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Chocolate powder</em> may not contain more than 68 % of sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>


<h5>VI.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cacao butter</em> is the fat obtained from the hulled bean or
cacao mass.</p>


<p class="center"><em class="gesperrt">Milk and Cream Chocolates.</em></p>

<p>1. Cream, milk and skimmed milk-chocolates are products
which are manufactured with addition of cream, milk (skimmed or
unskimmed) in a natural, thickened or dry form. They must be declared
as cream, milk or skimmed milk chocolates.</p>

<p>2. The fat content of full milk should amount to at least 3 per
cent., and that of cream itself 10 percent. If the full milk or cream
is added in a condensed or dried state, these ingredients must be in
corresponding proportions. As it is at present not possible to produce
a cream powder containing at least 55 percent of fat, the normal
preparation of this class is, for the time being, represented by a production
containing 5.5 percent of milk fat in the form of cream
and milk.</p>

<p>3. Milk chocolate prepared from skimmed milk must contain
at least 12.5 percent of dried milk or skim-milk, and “Cream”
chocolates not less than 10 percent of cream or full-cream powder.</p>

<p>4. The percentage of the milk or cream preparation added must
in all chocolates be deducted only from the percentage of the sugar,
i. e. the cacao content of all chocolates containing these ingredients
must be the same as in the case of the commoner varieties.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Special notice.</em> In the case of butter chocolates, in which
the cream is replaced by pure cacao fat, the same regulations naturally
obtain; thus the amount of butter added must be not less than
5.5 percent of the whole, and the butter should be used in place of
the sugar only.</p>

<p>(Regulations relating to the manner of examining chocolates as
to the presence of the prescribed quantities of the above ingredients
will probably be issued in the course of a year or two.)</p>


<h4><b>c. Vienna Regulations.</b></h4>

<p>The Assembly of Microscopical and Food Chemists in Vienna,
held on the 12th-13th October 1897, the object of which was to fix
a “Codex Alimentarius Austriacus”, also arrived at some just and
appreciable definitions, which are well worthy of repetition here:<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>1. Chocolate should consist of a mixture of cacao, Austrian
sugar capable of fermentation, further an addition of spices (cinnamon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
cloves, vanilla or vanillin) amounting to as much as 1 percent of
the whole.</p>

<p>2. Cacao mass should consist of the roasted and shelled cacao
bean, ground and moulded, only.</p>

<p>3. Cocoa Powder should be a preparation obtained from cacao
mass only by the partial expression of the 50 percent of fat which
the latter contains and frequently treated with alkalis. The alkalis
may reach 2 percent of the whole, and the object of the treatment
with them is to effect the disintegration of the tissues of cacao or to
render the cacao “soluble</p>


<h4><b>d) International Definitions.</b></h4>

<p>An International Congress of Chocolate and Cocoa Manufacturers
was finally held in Berne on August 21st-23rd 1911, which,
unlike the meeting held by the White Cross in Geneva (1908), the
object of which was the prevention of food adulterations, was really
international and attended by numerous manufacturers from Belgium,
Germany, England, France, Holland, Italy, Mexico, Austria, Hungary,
Russia and Switzerland, the total number of visitors amounting
to 250.<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>


<h5>1. <em class="gesperrt">Cacao Mass.</em></h5>

<p>§ 1. Cacao mass is obtained by roasting or drying<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> cacao
beans which have previously been well cleaned and freed from the
shells and dust. Cacao mass can either be disintegrated, i. e. “soluble”
or untreated with disintegrating agents, i. e. “insoluble</p>

<p>Cacao which has been treated according to § 5 is in the real
and business sense of the term to be regarded as a <em class="gesperrt">pure</em> article of
food, seeing that the treatment with alkaline carbonates or pure
alkali is a purely chemical, or technical, operation. Such cacao may
therefore be justly termed “pure</p>

<p>§ 2. Cacao mass may contain a quantity of added cacao butter
proportionate to the prescribed, or suitable, fat content of the cacao
preparation to be made.</p>


<h5>2. <em class="gesperrt">Cocoa Powder.</em></h5>

<p>§ 3. Cocoa powder should consist of defatted, or fatty, pulverised
cacao mass.</p>

<p>§ 4. Cocoa powder which has been opened up by means of
alkalis or otherwise is termed “soluble” or disintegrated cacao.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>Disintegrated cacao which has been treated as described under
§ 5 may in the real and business sense of the word be regarded as a
“pure” article of food, as the treatment with alkaline carbonates or
pure alkalis is a purely chemical, or technical, operation. Such cacao
may, therefore, be justly termed “pure</p>

<p>§ 5. The quantity of alkali used to effect the treatment described
should not exceed 5·75<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> grammes of potash or the equivalent
of another alkaline carbonate, to 100 grammes of dry defatted cacao.</p>


<h5>III. <em class="gesperrt">Cacao Butter.</em></h5>

<p>§ 6. Cacao butter consists of the fat obtained from either
untreated or disintegrated cacao.</p>


<h5>IV. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate Powder</em>.</h5>

<p>§ 7. Chocolate is a mixture of cacao mass and sugar, with or
without the addition of cacao butter. On pulverising chocolate,
<em class="gesperrt">chocolate powder</em> is obtained.</p>

<p>§ 8. Both chocolate and chocolate powder may, if the methods
of manufacture require it, be prepared from partially defatted
cacao mass.</p>

<p>§ 9. The amount of cacao mass and cacao butter contained in
chocolates and chocolate powders should be at least 32 percent<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>
of the whole.</p>


<h5>V. <em class="gesperrt">Milk Chocolate.</em></h5>

<p>§ 10. Milk chocolate should consist of a mixture of cacao mass,
cacao butter, sugar and milk or milk powder. The quantity of cacao
mass and cacao butter contained in such preparations should amount
together to at least 25 percent<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> of the whole.</p>

<p>§ 11. All chocolates which are brought on to the market under
the name of milk chocolate, must contain at least 12·5 percent of
milk or milk powder.</p>

<p>§ 12. No milk used for the preparation of milk chocolate may
contain any preserving agent.</p>


<h5>VI. <em class="gesperrt">Covering Matter.</em></h5>

<p>§ 13. The definitions of chocolate proper apply also to covering
material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>§ 14. Covering chocolate may, without special designation,
contain up to 5 percent of its weight as sold of almonds, nuts, milk
or milk powder. All other additions must be clearly declared on the
packages in which the covering material is sold, or in the invoices
referring to it.</p>


<h5>VII. <em class="gesperrt">Flavouring matter</em> (Spices).</h5>

<p>§ 15. All material (spices etc.) used for flavouring cacao preparations
must be harmless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span><a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<h4><a name="C_Adulterations_of_Cacao_wares_and_their" id="C_Adulterations_of_Cacao_wares_and_their">C. Adulterations of Cacao wares and their
Recognition.</a></h4>


<h5>a) Introductory.</h5>

<p>Cacao preparations are subject to manifold and various kinds
of adulteration. The following table gives a list of proved adulterating
agents, and contains in the last column but one hints as to how
such foreign additions can be detected, which hints are given in
more detail on various pages in this edition, the numbers of which
are annexed in the last column.</p>

<p>Bases for the judgment of cacao preparations appear on the
one hand in the definitions and formulas previously given, and on the
other in the rougher and finer adulterations which we had the
opportunity of detecting. We give these bases once more, at least
such as we deem necessary to a proper estimation of the purity of
cacao goods, and in general rather incline to the principles which
Filsinger has worked out for the Imperial Health Office (Germany)
and which received a hearty reception at the hands of the various
unions connected with the trade.</p>


<h5>b) The Principles.</h5>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Cacao material</em>, and <em class="gesperrt">cocoa powder</em>
(defatted and disintegrated cacao) may on no account contain any
kind of foreign vegetable mixtures like starch, meal, peanut cake,
hazel nut and walnut admixtures, nor cacao shells nor yet waste
products, neither may it contain any mineral stuffs or foreign fats.
Chocolates with meal addition must contain on the wrapper a concise
and definite declaration of such addition on the wrapper. The presence
of cacao shells is detrimental to the nutritious value of the cacao
preparation, being little suited for human consumption, as they contain
a large quantity of woody substance, and apart from this, always
occur with adhering sand and earth. The removal of such shells is
since the perfecting of the cleaning machinery intended for the
purpose, become a very easy matter, and so none but very inferior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
quantities are permissible. Any additional shells (even when declared,
and very fine ground) are illegal. The addition of spices or their
corresponding ethereal oils are allowed, and as such may be considered
almonds and nuts, more especially in the case of coating
material and so forth, although they are subject to compulsory
declaration.</p>

<p>The same conditions prevail in the case of <em class="gesperrt">chocolate
enamelling</em> and <em class="gesperrt">coating</em> material as for ordinary chocolate,
and in particular they must be free from all kind of foreign fats and
cacao shells.</p>

<p>The use of dyes (earth-and tar-colouring matter) which are
intended as substitutes for a percentage of cacao, and not merely as
ornamental, is not permissible; and such dyes as are objectionable
from a hygienical standpoint are impossible, even when they are
used for decorating purposes. Cacao material contains on an average
from 3-4 % of ash and from 50-55 % of fat.</p>

<p>Admixtures of glue, tragacanth or dextrine are not permissible,
when they are intended to conceal an addition of water or to save
the use of expensive cacao fat.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Cocoa powder</em> contains arbitrary quantities of fat, and
shows accordingly a varying quantity of ash to correspond with the
amount of fat expressed. It is therefore necessary to declare the
quantity of fat contained in quite a general manner and something in
the following grade: skimmed milk cacao under 25 % of fat, cacao
freed from oil, fatty and ordinary milk chocolate up to a percentage
not exceeding 35.<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> For the same reason it is necessary to convert the
established ash contents, possibly of cacao material with 50% of fat,
or none at all. It is most to the purpose to convert in the case of dry
material which has been freed of fat, as occasionally considerable
amounts of moisture remain over from the processes of preparation.
Cocoa powder which has been disintegrated without the use of
potassium, sodium or magnesia agents (carbonic acid) will therefore
show the same ash contents as the corresponding material freed from
oil, whilst that of cacao disintegrated by means of the fixed alkalis
will be greater. The ash contents of powder freed of oil may
nevertheless not exceed 3 %, corresponding to a total 7 %. The mixture
of cocoa powder and sugar is not permissible.</p>

<p>Chocolates, chocolate fondants and coating mass contain
variable quantities of sugar and fat; accordingly no limits can be
assigned to the ash contents of these preparations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

<p>A unanimity of opinion as to the least possible amount of
cacao for the chemical estimation of chocolate has become an urgent
necessity. Hereby it should be established that in good chocolate the
fatty contents, apart from the sugar,<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> exceed a definite percentage.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
A minimum percentage of 35% of cacao mass in chocolate destined for
export, which must possibly be covered, has been fixed by the council
of commerce.</p>

<p>As percentage of chocolate in cacao the double quantity of non-fatty
cacao material must be taken, on the supposition that raw cacao
contains on an average 50% of fat.</p>


<h5>c) Laws and Enactments as to Trade in Cacao Preparations.</h5>

<p>So far traffic in cacao has only been brought under legal control
in three European countries, namely Belgium, Roumania, and Switzerland.
We annex in the following pages a resumé of the legal prescriptions
appertaining thereto, as being of especial importance to
exporting manufacturers.</p>


<h6>1 <em class="gesperrt">Belgium.</em></h6>

<p>The <em class="gesperrt">Belgian</em> royal decree of the 18th November 1894
established on the basis of the law for articles of consumption, August
4th 1890, and article 454 to 457, 500 to 503, and 561 of the penal
code book runs (according to the “Moniteur Belge” of the 3rd and
4th December, 1894, as follows:</p>

<p>Art. 1. It is illegal to sell, expose or hold in possession for
sale, or to transmit, any other product as “all cocoa” than the fruit
of the cacao tree, raw and prepared by roasting, hulling and grinding
with or without addition of spices, and finally moulded into tablets
or reduced to powder form.</p>

<p>It is permissible to sell, expose or have in possession for sale,
or to transmit such cacao as has suffered a loss of butter by expressing,
provided that the amount of this ingredient is not diminished
by more than 20 % of the whole, under the designation “cocoa or cocoa
powder”; and again under the designation “alkalinised cacao” (cacao<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
alcalinisé) such as has had its alkali content increased in special treatment
by not more than 3% of the total weight. The declaration
“alkalinised” is not, if a matter of mere possession or transmittance
in export, to be considered as necessary.</p>

<p>Cacao which has been prepared other than as above described
may only be sold, exposed or held in possession for sale, or transmitted,
under a special label which declares this special manner of
preparation next to the word “cacao” or under a label that does not
contain the word “cacao” at all.</p>

<p>The word “alkalinised” or any other words which indicate
alterations or additions in the natural composition of the cacao must
be introduced on the label in distinct and similar type to the word
“cacao</p>

<p>Cacao in which the proportion of alkali amounts to more than
3% is regarded as injurious, and the sale, having and holding in
possession or despatch of same for sale is illegal.</p>

<p>Art. 2. It is illegal to sell, have in possession or expose for
sale, or to transmit any product whatever, under the designation
“chocolate”, that is not manufactured exclusively from shelled cacao,
and that in a minimum proportion of 35%, and ordinary sugar, with
or without admixture of spices.</p>

<p>Products which though containing the requisite 35% of shelled
cacao are also made of other substances than those above signified
may only be sold, held in possession, exposed or transmitted for sale
under a label that clearly describes the nature of such ingredients
next to the word “chocolate” and in the same type, or under a label
that does not contain the word “Chocolate” at all. In the case indicated
by impressing them on each separate tablet.</p>

<p>Products which contain less than 35% of cacao may only be
sold, held in possession, exposed, or transmitted for sale under the
designation “cacao bonbons” or some similar description, from which
the word chocolate has been rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>Art. 3. Entries of the labels prescribed for the products of
irregular composition in articles 1 and 2 must be made on the invoices
despatched with the goods.</p>

<p>Art. 4. The box, case or wrapper etc. containing cacao or
chocolate which is sold, exposed, held in possession or transmitted
for sale must bear the name and address of the manufacturer or
seller, or at least some regular and authorised trade mark.</p>

<p>Art. 5. The articles of this decree, as far as they refer to
chocolate, are only applicable to ordinary chocolates in tablet, block,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
spherical or powder form, not however to cream and various sugar
confections in chocolates (such as pralinés, pastilles etc.).</p>

<p>Art. 6. Any infringement of the articles of this decree will
incur a fine in accordance with the code of fines issued on Aug. 4th
1890, over and above the ordinary penalties.</p>

<p>Art. 7. Our Board of Trade and Agriculture is hereby entrusted
with the carrying out of this decree, which shall come into force on
April 1st 1895.</p>


<h6>2. Roumania.</h6>

<p>The royal enactment of this land respecting the health supervision
of foods and drinks and the trade in foods and drinks, articles
154, 155, 156 and 157 of the Health act of the 11th September, 1895,
says the “Buletinul directiunei generale a serviciului sanitar” 1895,
No. 18 and 19, pages 277 et seq.</p>

<p>No. XIII, Article 137.</p>

<p>No product may be sold, exposed or held in possession or
transmitted for sale, under the designation cacao, other than the seed
of the fruit obtained from the tree “Theobroma Cacao It may be
brought on the market raw, roasted, or powdered after roasting.</p>

<p>Under the designation “Cocoa powder, defatted”, such may be
sold as has suffered loss of butter by extraction, provided that there
still remains a minimum 22% of cacao butter in the product. As
disintegrated cacao may be sold such powder as does not contain
more than a maximum 2% of sodium or potassium carbonate.</p>

<p>Art. 138. It is illegal to sell or expose for sale artificially dyed
and pulverised cacao, and also such as has been mixed with starch
meals, foreign fats or any other foreign ingredients. It is in like
manner illegal to mix cocoa powder with shells, and the former may
not contain more than a maximum 15% of powdered shell.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Art. 139. Under the designation “Chocolate”, only the foodstuff
prepared from a mixture of roasted and powdered bean and sugar,
with or without admixture of aromatic ingredients, as vanilla,
cinnamon and the like substances, may be sold and exposed for sale.</p>

<p>Art. 140. The manufacture and sale, as also the exposure for
sale of chocolate from cacao that does not answer the several
demands of this decree, articles 137 and 138, as well as of chocolate
that is mixed with starch, meals, mineral and artificially coloured
substance, is illegal.</p>

<h6>3. Switzerland.</h6>

<p>The association of analytic chemists in this country have
issued a book entitled “The Swiss Book of Nutritious Stuffs and
Articles of Sustenance”, where the methods and standards prevailing
in research work connected with such substances are finally established
for Switzerland. This work served as a guide as regards articles
of sustenance up to the time when the Swiss food act came into force,
and we accordingly annex a few extracts from it, dealing with our
subject, cacao preparations.</p>


<p class="center">Definitions.</p>

<p>1. Cacao mass is obtained by grinding and moulding the shelled
and roasted cacao bean, without any admixture whatever, or extraction
of butter.</p>

<p>2. Cacao <em class="gesperrt">freed of oil</em> is cacao that has been reduced by
from 20% to 35% as regards its butter contents by means of pressure
under heat.</p>

<p>3. <em class="gesperrt">Disintegrated cacao.</em> The roasted beans are treated
with carbonic acid alkalis (generally potassium) subjected to pressure
under ammonia or steam, and so the cellular tissue of the albuminous
substance disintegrated or broken up and converted into a soluble
modification (peptone and alkalinous albuminate).<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The so treated
beans are next dried, reduced, defatted and pulverised.</p>

<p>4. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em> is the description of a mixture of cacao and
sugar which comes into commerce either moulded or in powder form.
The percentage of sugar amounts to between 40 and 70%. Admixture
of other substances than cacao, sugar and the usual spices must be
regarded as adulterations.<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>5. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em> and <em class="gesperrt">cacao</em> (powdered or moulded) may be
aromatised with the following substances: vanilla, benjamin gum,
tolu and peru balsam, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.</p>

<p>6. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate fondants</em> are chocolates with an unusually
large proportion of sugar and fatty contents.</p>

<p>7. <em class="gesperrt">Milk chocolate</em> is a preparation prepared from milk,
sugar and cacao. It may not contain the preserving materials
dis-allowed for milk, such as boracic acid, borax, formic aldehyde and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
derivatives of the aromatic series. It comes into commerce in
powder form.</p>

<p>8. <em class="gesperrt">Covering</em> or <em class="gesperrt">coating</em> material is a mixture of cacao,
sugar, spices, with almonds and hazel nuts. This preparation is almost
exclusively employed for bonbon confectionery.</p>

<p>9. <em class="gesperrt">Medicinal Chocolate</em> is a chocolate or cacao preparation
containing additions of medicaments.</p>

<p class="center">Tests and Definitions always to be applied.</p>

<ul>
<li>1.  Touch test.</li>
<li>2.  Reaction.</li>
<li>3.  Microscopical examination.</li>
<li>4.  Examination of the fat.</li>
<li>5.  Estimation of cacao butter.</li>
<li>6.  Determination of sugar.</li>
<li>7.  Determination of ash.</li>
</ul>


<p class="center">Tests and Definitions eventually necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li>8.  Determination of moisture.</li>
<li>9.  Determination of theobromine.</li>
<li>10.  Determination of starch.</li>
<li>11.  Determination of cellulose.</li>
</ul>



<p class="center">Guide to Classification:</p>

<p>Unripe, badly fermented cacao beans and those which have
been attacked by insects or mould or have suffered during transport
from the influence of salt-water, should never be used for manufacturing
purposes.</p>

<p>Goods prepared from such beans have an unpleasant taste,
which it is impossible to get rid of by the various operations in the
course of manufacture. The use of all such beans is to be regarded
as adulteration. The tests to be applied for determining them are
tasting, microscopical examination and perhaps the estimation of the
common salt contained in them.</p>

<p>All good chocolates are of a fine brown colour. Grey-coloured
or spotted chocolate are objectionable. Spots or the grey colour
alluded to may be caused either by damp or heat. At an ordinary
temperature the fracture of the chocolate is hard, glassy and even.
The quality of the fracture constitutes an excellent basis in judging
of the manner and methods employed in working up the raw material.</p>

<p>Cacao and chocolate that become thick and pulpy on boiling
are in all probability adulterated with meal, starch, dextrine or resin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>The following are to be considered as adulterations:</p>

<p>1. Admixtures of cacao or other shells, and sawdust.</p>

<p>2. Admixtures of foreign starch, meals, castania and resin.</p>

<p>3. Admixtures of mineral substances like ochre, clay and sand.</p>

<p>4. The substitution of cheaper fats, such as beef and pork
dripping, almond, poppy seed, cocoa-nut and vaseline oils.</p>


<p class="center">Limitations.</p>

<p>1. For <em class="gesperrt">cacao material</em>.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>2. <em class="gesperrt">For cacao fat.</em> Melting point 29 to 33·5° C.; freezing point
24 to 25° C.; refraction at 40° C., 46 to 49<a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>; iodine value 34 to 37;
point of saponification, 192 to 202.</p>

<p>3. <em class="gesperrt">Disintegrated cacao</em>: the amount of added alkali
is not to exceed 3%. In no case shall the ash content be more than
8%. This figure is not inconsistent with the above stated maximum
ash content, as disintegrated or soluble cacao is manufactured from
a mixture of several sorts of cacao, in each of which (although they
have been defatted) there is not more than 5% of ash.</p>

<p>4. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em>: although at the present time there are no
limits fixed for cacao and sugar, it may nevertheless be safely
assumed that the fat and sugar together may not exceed 80 to 85%,
and that the rest shall be pure non-fatty cacao material, in the proportion
of from 15-20%. The ash in a good chocolate does not
exceed 3·5%.</p>

<p>5. <em class="gesperrt">Milk chocolate</em>: here the separate ingredients require
a thorough drying. If the percentage of moisture amounts to as much
as five percent, the whole preparation is objectionable and liable
to lose its hard consistency.</p>

<p>6. <em class="gesperrt">Chocolate</em> à la noisette, <em class="gesperrt">oat</em>, <em class="gesperrt">meat</em> and <em class="gesperrt">medicinal
chocolates</em>. The testing of these takes two chief directions:</p>

<p class="hang">1. It must be established that the ingredients given on the
label are of good quality, and</p>

<p class="hang">2. that only the ingredients there mentioned occur in the
packet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>The constituents and their proportions shall be declared on
the wrappers in the case of medicinal chocolate.</p>

<p>On the 1st July then, in the year 1909, the act passed in connection
with foods and articles of consumption December 5th, 1905
came into force in Switzerland. Thereby the whole of Swiss trade
in such foodstuffs and articles of consumption is systematically controlled.
Of the 268 articles which are generally representative, we
annex here those concerning cacao, powder and chocolate, namely,
nos 146 to 149.</p>

<p><b>Art. 146.</b> Under the designation <em class="gesperrt">cacao</em> or <em class="gesperrt">cacao powder</em>
only the pure, unaltered or only partially defatted natural product
may be brought into commerce.</p>

<p>A cacao powder may only be described as <em class="gesperrt">soluble</em> when it
has been treated with carbonic acid alkalis or disintegrated with
steam.</p>

<p>Soluble cacao may only contain 3% added alkalis on the
outside.</p>

<p><b>Art. 147.</b> Under the designation <em class="gesperrt">chocolate</em>, only a mixture
of cacao and sugar with or without addition of cacao butter
and spices is to be understood, and no other may be brought on the
market as such.</p>

<p>The percentage of sugar in chocolate may not exceed 68.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p><b>Art. 148.</b> Cacao and chocolate may not contain starch, meal,
foreign fat, mineral substances, colouring matter and so-called fat
economisers (dextrine, gelatine, resin and tragacanth) and only traces
of cacao shell. They may not be gritty nor foul smelling nor
otherwise spoilt.</p>

<p><b>Art. 149.</b> Special products of cacao and chocolate with addition
of oats, milk, acorns and hazel nuts must be declared accordingly
(as oat cacao, milk chocolate etc.). Fancy confections fall also under
this obligation.</p>

<p>Cacaos and chocolates which are put on the market in packets,
boxes and packages must contain the name of the firm on the
wrapper, or some mark of the manufacturer or salesman which is
recognised in Switzerland.</p>

<p>If saccharine, dulcine or other artificial sweetstuffs are added
to chocolate, such admixture must be declared on the wrapper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span><a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>


<h6>4. Austria.</h6>

<p>Legal control of the traffic in cacao preparations in this
country may be expected in the near future.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Austria</em> is indeed already in possession of a law (dated
January 19th, 1896) concerning the traffic in articles of consumption,
although the special determinations have hitherto not reached perfection,
and the treatment of the separate detailed articles must
proceed gradually. As in Switzerland, the Association of Food
Chemists and Analysts here have worked out designs for a “Codex
alimentarius austriacus The work of this code commission is of a
purely private nature and accordingly no official importance accrues
to it, but it is none the less recognised by all Austrian chemists and
has indirectly (and even in law courts) about the same weight as
the opinion of an expert, especially as the single articles of consumption
are almost exclusively limited to specialists in this country.
We therefore introduce the most important points of this code which
bear on our subject, although various alterations must be made in
these as they succeed to legal recognition, for since the appearance
of the code many changes have developed as regards the methods of
research.</p>


<p class="center">I. Cacao Mass.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Definition.</em> Under cacao mass is to be understood the
material constituting a regular and uniform dough when warmed,
which has been exclusively prepared and manufactured from the
shelled cacao bean.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Ingredients.</em> Cacao material contains the same ingredients
chemically as the shelled bean.</p>

<p>Microscopical investigation should only reveal the presence of
seed kernel, and not particles of root, which should be removed in
the course of preparation.</p>

<p>The ash may not exceed 3·5%<a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>, the fibre 3%<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>, and the
starch 10·5%. The amount of fat figures at between 48 and 52
percent.</p>


<p class="center">II. Cocoa powder.</p>

<p class="center">(Pulverised cacao, defatted, and disintegrated.)</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Definition.</em> Hereby is understood the steamed prepara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>tions
or the powder obtained by expressing at least half the total fat
from ordinary cacao material and further grinding and sifting.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Characteristics.</em> The cocoa powder shall on boiling
with 20 to 30 times its volume of water yield a suspension, in which
there are no traces of lumpy formation, and which does not show
a sediment after the expiration of a few minutes.<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Should there
be any such sediment, it shall be examined under the microscope.</p>

<p>Cocoa powder shall be sifted and ground free from meal, and
may not, on sifting through a miller gauze (No. 12) show more than
5% of material on the sieve.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of cocoa powder is modified according
to the degree of defatting. If 30 parts out of 100 are defatted,
which is the usual procedure. If 30 parts fat are expressed from
100 parts cacao material, which usually happens, then the cocoa
powder contains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>30% fat, 5% ash<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>, 3·5% fibre, and 13%.</p>

<p>The amount of moisture shall not exceed 6%.</p>

<p>The fat shall be pure cacao butter.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Addition of alkalis is not allowed.</em></p>

<p>Microscopical investigation as under I.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">III. Chocolate.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Definition.</em> Chocolate is the cacao material evenly and
regularly worked up with cane sugar (refined, ordinary or coarse).</p>

<p>The completely uniform pasty mass, when warmed, is allowed
to set in moulds and then forms pieces of fatty appearance, finely
granular or close fracture (tablets, blocks).</p>

<p>Good chocolate consists of 40 to 50 percent of cacao mass and
50 to 60 percent of sugar.</p>

<p>It may also contain a small amount of harmless aromatic substances.</p>

<p>Should the sum of the cacao fat and sugar in chocolate amount
to over 85 percent, it is termed “Sweetmeat chocolate”, and should
the sum of those ingredients be more than 90 percent, the chocolate
is to be declared as “Very sweet</p>

<p>All the ingredients in chocolate, after deducting the sugar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
shall be present in the same relative proportion and in the same
condition as in pure cacao mass (compare I).</p>

<p>Sweetened chocolate is an exception, in so far as it has had
in its preparation an addition of cacao butter. Fine kinds are also
prepared with an addition of defatted cacao.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Unmoulded</em> chocolate or chocolate powder shall answer
to the same requirements.</p>


<p class="center">IV. Cacao surrogate and chocolate surrogate.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Definition.</em> Cacao preparations containing admixtures
of meal are to be described as surrogates.</p>

<p>The addition of other substances than meal is inadmissible.</p>

<p>Absence of cacao husk is also required as in I, II, III.</p>

<p>Mixtures of cacao powder, sugar and meal are also to be
regarded as surrogates.</p>

<p>The extent of the addition of meal is to be distinctly noted by
the seller on the article sold.</p>


<p class="center">V. Couverture (coating mass).</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Definition.</em> This includes various preparations of pure
cacao butter and chocolate (or mixtures of chocolate with cacao
butter and cacao mass), which form a thin liquid, when warmed,
and are used for coating or pouring over confectionery. All other
substances (roasted hazel nuts or almonds and the like) shall be
declared.</p>


<p class="center">Investigation.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">To be carried out without exception with all
cacao preparations</em>:</p>

<p>1. <em class="gesperrt">Determination of fat.</em> The fat is extracted from
the dry substance which has been mixed with an indifferent body
(sand) by pure and absolutely dry ether (distilled over sodium) or
by petroleum ether. Cacao mass and chocolate must first be shaved
or rasped.</p>

<p>2. <em class="gesperrt">Jesting of the fat.</em></p>

<p>a) Determination of the melting point in a capillary tube (three
days after the fat has been melted into the tube).<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Pure cacao
butter usually melts at 33° C.</p>

<p>b) Determination of the iodine value; usually 35·0 with pure
cacao fat.</p>

<p>It is further recommended to make a refractometric determination,
which in a Zeiss butter-refractometer must be 46·5° at 40° C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>3. The <em class="gesperrt">microscopic test</em> of the substance, from which
the fat and the sugar have been removed.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">The following are also essential</em>:</p>


<p class="center">I. With cacao mass.</p>

<p>The determination of fibre and ash.</p>


<p class="center">II. Cacao powder.</p>

<p>Determination of moisture at 100° C., of the fibre and ash and
examination of the ash (quantitative determination of phosphoric acid
and potash).</p>


<p class="center">III. Chocolate.</p>

<p>Determination of the sugar by polarisation of the aqueous
solution.</p>


<p class="center">IV. Surrogates.</p>

<p>Determination of the starch.</p>

<p>If it is considered necessary to proceed further, then:</p>

<p>1. Determination of theobromine by a modification of Wolfram’s
method, the method employed is to be exactly stated.<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>2. In the determination of starch, the gelatinisation is to be
carried out under steam pressure and the inverted sugar gravimetrically
determined with Fehling’s solution.</p>

<p>An opinion of the quality of the preparation can be formed
from the taste, smell and colour of the sample on boiling with water.</p>


<h6>5. Germany.</h6>

<p>In <em class="gesperrt">Germany</em>, unfortunately, there is at present no law,
which regulates the trade in cacao goods. It is true that there exists
the decree of the 14th May, 1879 respecting the trade in food, alimentary
substances and comestibles, which contains the usual penal
enactments in regard to adulteration of food materials offered for
sale. The enactments are supplemented with data relating to the
administration of the law, among which a definition of chocolate, as
well as the means of judging as to the quality or its adulteration, are
treated of. But those data do not in all respects apply to existing
conditions, nor do they deal fully with the question as to what admixtures
are to be permitted or prohibited, for in the introduction to
the appendix A, there is the following statement:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>
<p>“Like the former provision, the present one is not intended
to be an <em class="gesperrt">exhaustive</em> description of all subjects of the kind referred
to, but a compilation of those examples which appear to be especially
calculated to serve as an illustration of legislative requirements.”</p>

<p>The data referred to have not an officially authoritative significance,
and they cannot be regarded as having established validity
in connection with the administration of the law by the police or
by legal authorities. (See: Commentary by Meyer-Finkenburg,
page 116.)</p>

<p>Even the complete publication of the “Vereinbarungen zur einheitlichen
Untersuchung von Nahrungs-und Genußmitteln sowie Gebrauchsgegenständen
für das Deutsche Reich”, collected at the instance
of the national health department, will not have the effect of
giving certainty in the law relating to the manufacture of chocolate.
That section of the “Vereinbarungen”, which deals with cacao products,
was published in Book III (Berlin, Julius Springer 1912) pages
68-81, but the conditions in Germany are at present only similar to
those existing in Switzerland and in Austria. The “Vereinbarungen”
are nothing more, than a valuable semiofficial guide for the valuation
and examination of food and comestibles, the provisions of which,
not being obligationary, have no legal effect. They have long been
in need of a thorough revision, as recent scientifical results testify,
and indeed “The Voluntary association of German Food Chemists”
have for years been engaged in such revision.</p>

<p>The consequence is, that the prosecution of various manipulation
which certainly deserve to be objected to, such as the preparation
of cacao or chocolate from undecorticated beans, would be
difficult to carry out. The Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers
has protested against that unsuitable state of affairs, and
since a remedy is to be looked for only from the enactment of a law
regulating the trade in cacao products, that association prepared a
draft act, at its XVII. annual meeting at Leipsic on the 15th January
1893, and has submitted it to the government health department.</p>

<p>That draft is in accordance with the provisions printed on
pages 231 and 232 a-e. The provisions of the association in reference
to the trade in cacao products also contain the following paragraphs:</p>


<p class="center">§ 2.</p>

<p>It is not to be considered adulteration or counterfeit, within
the meaning of the law (§ 10) relating to trade in food materials,
comestibles or articles of consumption (of 14th May 1879, Reichsgesetzblatt
page 145):</p>

<p>1. When the productions referred to under a, b, c are mixed with
meal or other substances for medicinal purposes, provided, they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
of a character by which they are distinctly recognisable, or are
kept in stock or offered for sale under a designation distinguishing
them from chocolate, cacao mass, or cacao powder.</p>

<p>2. When covering or coating material, or sweetmeat chocolate
is mixed with burnt almonds or hazel nuts to the extent of 5 %.</p>


<p class="center">§ 3.</p>

<p>Adulteration within the meaning of the law dated May 14th
1879, § 10 (Reichsgesetzblatt, page 145) comprises:</p>

<p>1. The addition of foreign fat to chocolate, cacao mass or
cacao butter.</p>

<p>2. The addition to chocolate, cacao material or cocoa powder
of cacao husk, meal or other substances, except in the cases
mentioned on page 279, § 2, pos. 1 and 2.<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>3. The addition of colouring materials to chocolate.</p>

<p>4. The addition to chocolate or chocolate surrogates of any but
cane sugars (beetroot sugar).</p>


<p class="center">§ 4.</p>

<p>As already pointed out, the terms of this proposed legislative
step naturally command approval and we should be the first to
welcome the appearance of a “Deutsches Lebensmittelbuch” or some
similar work<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>, intended to serve as an authoritative regulation of
the trade in cacao preparations and as a protection of honest manufacturers
against the uncertainty now attending legal proceedings.
In that case, other civilised countries might be expected to follow.</p>

powder factory.</a></h3>


<p>In constructing a new factory and fixing the situation of the
buildings, the first thing to be considered is their convenient arrangement.
It is therefore advisable to rely upon an experienced person
for the plan to be adopted, and then to leave the proper construction
of the works in the hands of the architect. Small operations can be
carried on in any building, but in the case of larger works a well
devised arrangement of the machines and appliances must be decided
upon before hand, that will admit of rational and, to some extent,
automatic working. In case of erecting small works which will
require only one manager, the best plan would be to have the whole
manufacture carried out on one story, or at the most two stories, to
facilitate supervision.</p>

<p>The case is different with large works, in which the different
departments are controlled by especially qualified persons.</p>

<p>Tables I and II<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> represent, in section, a chocolate factory
and a cacao powder factory. As both plans represent only a model
section, they serve only to show the most convenient arrangement
of the machines with each other. In reality there would be more
or less machines of the same kind placed together. Such arrangements
might, with modifications, serve for medium sized works, as
well as for larger ones. In that sense the following explanations
of the two plans are to be understood.</p>

<h4 id="x1_Chocolate_factory_Table_I"><b>1. Chocolate factory</b> (Table I).</h4>

<p>By means of the lift (1) all the raw materials, sugar, cacao,
packing materials, etc. are carried up to the store rooms (2). In
these occur the machines for cleansing and picking the raw cacao
beans. The raw cacao is fed into the elevator boxes (3), above
the cleansing machine (4) where it is freed from dust; it passes to the
continuous band (5) where it is picked and then falls into the movable
boxes (6). It is then transferred to the hoppers (7) and is fed, by
opening a slide in the hoppers, into the roasting machine (8). The
capacity of the hoppers is sufficiently large for holding the quantity
of beans for charging the roasting machine. After the roasting is
completed, the cacao is emptied into the trucks (9) and carried to
the exhaust arrangement (10) where the beans are cooled down and
the vapour given off is passed out into the open air. At the same
time, the roasting chamber is sucked out through the funnel shaped
tube fitted to the cover of the chamber. The roasted cacao is then
passed to the boxes (11) to be conveyed by the elevator to the
crushing and cleansing machine (12). After being cleansed, the cacao
is carried in trucks (13) to the hoppers (14) by which they are fed into
the mills (15) in the lower floor. The sugar mill and the sifting
apparatus (27) placed near the crushing and cleansing machines are
also fed by a hopper from above. The dust sugar, there produced,
is carried by the lift (1) to the machine room on the first floor. Cacao
and sugar are there supplied to the incorporator (16) to be worked
together, before being passed to the rolling mill (17), where the final
rubbing is effected. After passing once or oftener through the mill,
the finished chocolate mass is then taken to the hot room (18) where
it remains in boxes until further treated and it is then taken to the
moulding room. In the incorporator (19) the mass acquires the consistence
necessary for moulding and also the requisite temperature.
The mass is then taken in lumps to the dividing machine (20) and
cut into pieces of the desired size and weight. On the table (21) the
moulds, lying upon boards, are filled with the pieces of chocolate
and they are then taken to the shaking table (22).</p>

<p>From this they succeed to the cooling arrangement, which
consists of an endless chain provided with travelling stages at definite
and regular intervals. The latter moves slowly through the
artificially cooled room and finally brings the moulds to the outlet
(25) where the chocolate is removed. It is then transferred on the
lift to the packing and despatching apartments specially reserved for
these operations, but not distinctly noticeable on our section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<h4><b>2. Cacao powder factory</b> (Table II).</h4>

<p>The course of manufacture of cacao powder is the same as
in the manufacture of chocolate, up to the point where the cacao has
passed through the crushing and cleansing machines (12). The
broken beans are then taken by the elevator (27) to the machine for
separating the radicles (28) and thence through the hopper (14) to
the mills (15). The liquid cacao mass, passing from these mills, runs
into the pans (29) from which as much required for charging the
hydraulic presses as is can be drawn up by cocks. The accumulator
(31) supplies all the presses with water. The pressed cakes are first
put into the boxes of the frame (32). In an adjoining room is the
automatic cacao pulverizing apparatus. It is fed through the preliminary
crusher (34) from which the cacao is taken by the worm and
elevator (35) to the pulveriser (36). The powdered cacao is then
taken by a worm and elevator to the sifting machine (38).</p>

<p>The sifted powder falls into the tub (39) while the coarser
portion is carried back again to the pulveriser (36). The arrangements
for treating and the disintegrating cacao powder can be
provided in the manner already described.</p>

<p>In both plans, the boiler and engine house are to be understood
as placed in an adjoining building.</p>

<p>Containing an account of the methods of preparation and the composition
of some Commercial dietetic and other Cacao preparations.</p>


<p>The following statements and recipes have no pretension to
be complete; they are only introduced to serve as a brief summary
of those commercial cacao preparations, now in commerce, which are
mixtures of various kinds of substances with cacao or chocolate and
are largely used for dietetic purposes. Notwithstanding its necessary
incompleteness, the following account, which has been collected from
various sources, will satisfy practical requirement, since the manufacturer,
as well as the food chemist, frequently desires to obtain
information at once, that even a complete technical library is not
always able to supply. Medicinal chocolates have not been considered
in the following list, since they belong to the province of
pharmacy.</p>

ash 3·73 percent.<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>


<p>Acorn-cacao can be prepared by mixing 10 parts of pure
cacao mass, 20 parts defatted cacao powder, 5 parts roasted
barley meal, 35 parts of the meal from shelled and roasted acorns
(or 10 parts of an aqueous extract of roasted acorns), 30 parts
powdered sugar, and 2 parts pure calcium phosphate.</p>

<p><b>Acorn-chocolate</b> is a mixture of 100 parts shelled and roasted acorns
with 500 parts sugar and 400 parts cacao mass in addition to
spices.</p>

<p><b>Acorn-malt-cacao (Dieterich)</b> is prepared by mixing 1 kilo of acorn

<p><b>Acorn-malt-chocolate (Dieterich)</b> is prepared by accurately mixing
2 kilos acorn malt extract (Dieterich-Helfenberg) with 3½ kilos

<p><b>Albuminous chocolate and cacao.</b> Riquet &amp; Co. of Leipsic have protected
a process by various patents<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> for “The production of
a tasty and genuine chocolate or cocoa powder<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> rich in
albuminous constituents.” The kernels of the thoroughly roasted
bean are worked up with a mixture (?) of water and dry albumen,
allowed to stand for some time, the water evaporating, and then
the beans are worked up once more. Instead of water an aqueous
sugar solution may also be employed, and further the addition of
albumen may occur at any stage<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> and in particular when sugar
solution is first taken, then the albumen and sugar necessary
for the chocolate mixed up, and finally the cacao material (with
additions of cacao oil) added. Still better (than the sugar solution)
would it be, if the albumen were incorporated in the choco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>late
or cocoa material in the form of a mixture with some
emulsion (!), especially a mixture with milk.</p>

<p><b>Barley-chocolate</b> is prepared by mixing 1 kilo of prepared barley
meal<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> 4½ kilos powdered sugar and 4½ kilos cacao mass. The
moulded chocolate is to be coated with varnish.</p>

<p><b>Cacao and chocolate preparations containing milk</b> are prepared
according to A. Denayer, Brussels (German patent No. 112220,
4 February 1899) by evaporating, in the open air, a mixture of
milk and sugar to the consistency of cream, and to the hot mass,
defatted or not defatted cacao is added in the form of powder.
The resulting mixture is spread out in thin layers and exposed
to the influence of a temperature of 80-100°C. in a rarefied
atmosphere, then finally completely dried at a lower or ordinary
temperature under the same conditions.</p>

<p><b>Cacao-egg-cream</b> (so called African punch) is thus prepared: 10 yolks
of eggs are beaten up with 300 grammes of syrup (1 part sugar to
2 parts water) and, whilst being continually whisked up, 500
grammes of cacao essence (see next paragraph) are added. The
whole is to be iced before being consumed.</p>

<p><b>Cacao-essence</b> is prepared by macerating 125 grammes of defatted
cacao, 2 grammes vanilla, 2 grammes cinnamon, 0·75 gramme
cloves, 0·3 gramme mace and 0·10 gramme of ginger with
750 grammes of proof spirit and 250 grammes of water for 8
days, and then filtering into hot syrup, which is prepared with
550 grammes of sugar and 750 grammes water.</p>

<p><b>Cacao-liqueur.</b> A well tested recipe for the preparation of this liqueur
is to the following effect: Defatted cacao 200 grammes, cinnamon
powder 5 grammes, vanillin 0·2 gramme, are digested for 6 days
with 1500 grammes of water and 1700 grammes of alcohol (90%)
and then mixed with 2600 grammes syrup (1400 parts sugar and
1200 parts of water) and filtered.</p>

<p><b>Cacaophen Sieberts</b> (Cassel) is a mixture of cacao powder with flour,
sugar and milk albumin. It shows the following numbers on
analysis: fat 13·23 percent, water 7·7 percent, albumin 24·25
percent, soluble carbohydrates 17·95 percent, insoluble carbohydrates
(starch) 26·66 percent, woody fibre 2·27 percent,

<p><b>Chocolate-cream-syrup</b> (for aërated waters): 125 grammes of rasped
chocolate, 62 grammes cacao powder and 325 grammes of water
are well mixed and to this add 148 grammes infusion of quillaia
(1·8). After standing some time add the contents of a pot of
condensed milk with 7·5 grammes of boric acid and make up
with 3·8 litres of sugar syrup (american recipe).</p>

<p><b>Chocolat digestif</b> (Vichy chocolate) is a mixture of chocolate with
about 5 percent of sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<p><b>Chocolate-health-beer</b>, J. Scholz (German patent No. 28819). An
extract is prepared from 10 kilos of cacao beans, which have
been kiln-dried at 75° C., shelled, broken in small pieces and
digested for half an hour with twice their weight of distilled
water at 62° C., then boiled for another half an hour and finally
allowed to stand for 48 hours at a temperature of 75° C., with
an addition of a solution of 10 kilos of sugar in distilled water,
then once more boiled until one half of the water, originally
added, has been evaporated. It is filtered, in as warm a condition
as possible, in order to separate pieces of cacao and fat,
and the extract is ready for use. The brewing process is similar
to that of brewing Bavarian beer. After the finished wort
obtained in that process has been boiled for 3 hours, 100 litres
are taken, for which 35 kilos of pale kiln-dried barley meal have
been used, and to this are added 200 grammes of the best
Bavarian hops and 12 kilos of cacao extract. The whole is once
more boiled and the subsequent operation then carried out as
usual. The fermentation (at 7·5° C.) occupies 7-8 days and the
storage in the fining vats 3-4 weeks.</p>

<p><b>Chocolat rétablière</b>, a Vienna speciality, contains reduced metallic
iron, dried meat, pea and wheat flour, sugar and cacao in uncertain
proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p><b>Chocolate-syrup</b> (for soda and seltzer water). 250 grammes of defatted
cacao powder are rubbed down with 2½ litres of boiling
water in a porcelain basin on a steam bath, until it is in the
condition of an uniformly thick mass and then 1 kilo pot of condensed
milk and 2·5 kilos of powdered sugar are added, and
when the sugar is dissolved the vessel is cooled. After cooling,
the fatty particles on the surface are carefully removed, and
then 30 grammes of commercial vanilla extract and 30 grammes
of mucilage (from gummi arabicum) are added, and the whole
filtered through a stout cotton cloth (american recipe).</p>

<p><b>Chocolate-tincture (cacao-tincture)</b> is prepared by macerating 1½
kilos of defatted cacao powder with 10 kilos of dilute alcohol
for 8 days and then filtering.</p>

<p><b>Corn-cacao contains</b> according to Notnagel<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>: water 6·10 percent,
fat 16·96 percent, albuminoids 19·81 percent, theobromine 0·68
percent, fibre 3·30 percent, non-nitrogenous extractives
48·69 percent, ash 4·46 percent. The preparation under the
microscope is shown to contain, in addition to the constituents
of cacao, a large amount of oat starch, and it may be regarded
as corresponding to a mixture of equal parts of defatted cacao
and oat meal, based on the above analysis and König’s mean
value.</p>

<p><b>Covering or coating materials</b> have the following composition: 50%
sugar, 30-35% fat and 20-15% cacao material free from fat,
whereby (especially in Belgium, e. g. Brussels) it is in part
supplanted by almonds, nuts etc. In such cases the iodine value
of the fat is equal to 41-42.</p>

<p><b>Diabetic chocolate</b> has the following composition.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Nitrogenous
substance 10·07 percent, fat 25·47 percent, levulose 19·38 per
cent, starch and cellulose 25·19 percent, besides non nitrogenous
substances 14·54 percent, saccharin 0·5 percent, mineral constituents
2·15 percent.</p>

<p>In this formula there is a disproportionately high percentage
of starch and cellulose and, in that respect, the composition
appears to be irrational, since the introduction of carbohydrates
into food for diabetics should be avoided as much as possible.
A more rational preparation would be a simple mixture of:</p>

<p class="center">

<p><b>Diabetic cacao</b> can be prepared according to J. Apt of Berlin by the
following patented process (German patent No. 116 173, 30. 1.
1900). The starch is first gelatinised by long boiling of the
coarsely powdered cacao, the mass then dried in a vacuum and
heated, or roasted at 130 to 140° C. in order to caramelise the
gelatinised starch (!). Before being boiled, it is recommended
to de-fat the cacao (with petroleum ether, for example!). Instead
of caramelising the gelatinised starch by heat direct, it can be
first converted into sugar by means of acid, then heated to
caramelisation and as much cacao fat added as may be desirable.
In order to increase its capability of emulsifying, dried albumin
is to be added.<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p><b>Dictamnia</b> of Groult and Boutron-Russel is composed of cacao, prepared
wheat flour, starch, sugar and vanilla.</p>

<p><b>v. Donat’s albumin chocolate</b> (German patent No. 82 434) is prepared
by mixing dried albumin in powder or in pieces with chocolate
or cacao mass, damped with a liquid medium, which does not
dissolve albumin, such as benzol, petroleum ether, ether, acetone,
methyl or ethyl alcohol. The mass is further treated in the mixer
and finally after being completely mixed, the added liquid is
allowed to evaporate.</p>

<p><b>Milk-chocolate</b> is prepared with 28 kilos of cacao mass, 36 kilos of
powdered cane sugar, 24 kilos of milk powder and 12 kilos of
cacao butter. The material is very finely rolled at 60-70°C.
in the grinding machine described on page 000, and the finished
mass not allowed to remain in the hot closet, but almost immediately
moulded and packed. The mild kinds of cacao (Ariba,
Caracas, Ceylon, Java) are the most suitable for making milk
chocolate.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of <em class="gesperrt">pure milk cacao</em>, the cacao<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
powder is worked up for some time in the warmed mixing
machine, the sugar and the milk powder being added successively.
Cacao preparations, which are only used as beverages with
water, should have at least two parts of pure milk powder to one
part of cacao powder in order to yield a suitable preparation.</p>

Recently so-called fermenting-houses, as recommended by L. Kindt.
(Cf. Kultur d. Kakaobaues und seine Schädlinge, Hambourg 1904), have answered
very well. Yet the chemismus of fermentation is by no means sufficiently explained,
and quantitatively and qualitatively, there is a lack of completeness in
the analyses bearing on the process.</p></div>

This had already been noticed by J. Hinchley Hart; Cacao (Trinidad

According to Schweizer (Pharmazeut. Ztg. 1898, page 389) these substances
would be represented by the chemical formula C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>86</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, corresponding
to 1 molecule cacao red, 6 molecules grape sugar, and 1 molecule
Theobromin.</p></div>

the bean when the cacao is fermented and dried; especially so also in the later

Aleuron granules were first microscopically observed by H. Molisch
(Grundriß einer Histochemie d. pflanzl. Genßmittel in the cellular tissue
of the cacao bean. They are very similar to the starch granules of the bean and
contain within them a relatively large globoid lime and magnesium phosphates

The “Machines for packing en masse” Co. Ltd. Berlin, have recently
strongly recommended their “wrapping machines, for centres of any shape or
consistency, which work automatically, that is to say, it is only necessary to heap
the centres in continuous succession in the machine, when they are urged forward
and wrapped in paper or other materials, being finally despatched out of the
machine automatically. The wrappers may be simple or double, loose, or tight
fitting.” Their employment in the packing of chocolate tablets is especially recommended.—And
so the problem would be solved! Unfortunately I am in
want of personal guidance, never yet having seen the machines in working order,
and so not being able to submit any opinion as to their efficiency. Even if
they are really able to deal with larger tablets, yet the more critical problem
regards the smaller goods, especially in connection with the wrapping in tin-foil.</p></div>

Merck’s Catalogue of Reacting Agents (2<sup>nd</sup>. Edition, page 88) gives a
convenient method of determining the presence of theobromine and caffeine
(Gerard’s reaction). We annex an extract.
</p>

<p>
<em class="gesperrt">Gerard’s Reaction on Theobromine.</em>
</p>
<p>
A mixture of 0·05 g of theobromine, 3 ccm of water and ccm of soda
wash is decomposed with 1 ccm of a silver nitrate solution 10 percent strong,
heated to 60 C. and the solution so obtained cooled down. It then gelatinises
very perceptibly. Caffeine does not give this reaction.

A word about the R.-M. number seems not out of place here. Baier
indeed gives it as an average 1·0 but it varies considerably, as his own investigations
show (8 tests of pressed or extracted fats), where there are fluctuations
of 1·65—2·37. Information kindly volunteered by Prof. Härtel and our own
experience convinces us that such fluctuations proceed generally from the Glycerine
employed, which has itself a R.-M. number, sometimes even amounting
to 1·0. It is therefore necessary to fix the standard of Glycerine used in the
experiment, only too much neglected in professional investigations.</p></div>

As starting point it may be taken for granted that the R. M. number
for milk chocolate is at a minimum 3·75, for cream chocolate 5·5 assuming that
10% cream possesses the R. M. number 3·0 and 20% that between 5·9-6.
Various roundabout calculations are so avoided, when the percentages of cream
are thus immediately converted into the R. M. number, and the method is quite
adequate for estimating purposes.</p></div>

According to recent resolutions of the Free Union (cf. page 282) the

The excessive use of cacao butter as an admixture has lately assumed
large proportions. In commerce there are to be found many preparations designated
as “pure cacao and sugar” which contain only 15 or 20% of cacao
with 50% of fat, which are said to met a need of the public, but the maintenance
will scarcely hold water.</p></div>

generally only the very inferior cacaos, like St. Thomé, Domingo, Cuba and

The “Deutsche Nahrungsmittelbuch” issued by the Association of Manufacturers
and Dealers Trading in Articles of Consumption has unfortunately
only complexed matters as it was a private undertaking and has endeavoured to
sanction various usages, better termed misusages, such as the use of forbidden

the part connected with cacao preparations constitutes a glorious exception, and
also that there are recent indications of an agitation to reform the whole code.</p></div>

According to Dieterich (Neues Pharmazeutisches Manual, 7. edition
page 191) prepared barley meal is obtained as follows: 1 kilo barley flour is
firmly pressed into a suitable metallic (tin) vessel, so that it is about 2/3 full and
then heated on a water bath for 30 hours in all. After the lapse of 10 hours
the powder is removed and ground in a mixer them again placed in the vessel
and re-heated for 10 hours. After twice repeating this manipulation, about 900
grammes of a reddish mass will be obtained which is prepared barley meal.</p></div>

The absurdity of this process is too evident to need remark; would it
not have been better, if the process had not had the sanction of the patent mark?
The treatment, which the cacao here undergoes, is so barbarous, that the product
must always be spoiled. The only point attained is the complete gelatinisation
of the starch, which by further heating is to some extent converted into dextrin.
Caramelizing cannot and will not take place by heating gelatinised starch in
mixtures with a dry substance, as it occurs in cacao. But in addition, the claim
is weak that cacao so mistreated would be especially suitable for diabetics, since
cacao serves that purpose a great deal better. The addition of albumin every
properly disintegrated is not at all new, for mixtures of albumin and cacao have
existed for a very long time.—Editor’s note.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
